**Domain Rating (DR):** 90  
**Estimated monthly organic search traffic:** 304,791

What better way to start the list than with a not-so-subtle plug of our own blog? We topped the poll with 793 votes, and the fact that you’re reading this means the Ahrefs team must be doing something right.

If you’re new here, our blog is split into four categories: SEO, marketing, data and studies, and product updates. Have a look-see, then settle in for the ride—you’re bound to learn something new, no matter your level of expertise.

**Domain Rating (DR):** 93  
**Estimated monthly organic search traffic:** 7,726,291

HubSpot is a powerful SaaS platform and the champion of [inbound marketing](https://ahrefs.com/blog/inbound-marketing/). We mean it literally: Founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah coined the term “inbound” and even published a book on the topic.

Over on the HubSpot blog, you’ll find in-depth articles, [free templates](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide), and [marketing reports](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?hubs_post-cta=mktg-homepage&hsCtaTracking=30db2890-9aaf-410f-a524-7de3b393119c%7Cb7322b20-f995-4dc8-ac8b-01f31325e585) that are backed by surveys and expert opinions.

We also highly recommend subscribing to The Hustle, a popular newsletter that HubSpot [acquired](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-hubspot-is-acquiring-the-hustle) in early 2021. Its coverage of business and tech news is at once snappy and concise—an ideal point of reference for anyone who wants to get better at writing.

Glen Allsopp runs two blogs: Gaps and also Detailed. And while they’re quite different in their areas of focus, we thought it best to combine them to avoid repetition.

Gaps.com covers mostly business-focused content and case studies on profitable niches. It’s better suited to founders and entrepreneurs or anyone interested in learning about fresh online business opportunities and revenue models.

General marketers may prefer Detailed.com, which includes technical SEO advice, keyword research tactics, plus interesting experiments for further learning.
