# HARO: Is It Alternatives You’re Looking For?

You probably clicked this result because a) you appreciate a good Lionel Ritchie pun, or b) you’ve heard that [HARO is dead](https://ahrefs.com/blog/rip-haro/) and want some alternatives—hopefully both.

Whatever the reason, in this article, I’ll share some alternatives to HARO and a few extra ways to get expert quotes and backlinks for your website.

## Best HARO alternatives (as voted for by ‘new HARO’ users)

Disclaimer: I am not a PR expert. I did a bit of outreach a few years ago, but I have only been an occasional user of HARO in the past year or so.

So, rather than providing _my_ opinion on the best alternatives to HARO, I thought it would be fun to ask users of the “new HARO” what _they_ thought were the best alternatives.

I wanted to give the “new HARO”—Connectively—the benefit of the doubt.

Still, a few minutes after my pitch was accepted, I got two responses that appeared to be AI-generated from two “visionary directors,” both with “extensive experience.”

My experience of Connectively so far mirrored [Josh’s experience of old HARO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/rip-haro/): The responses were most likely automated.

![Connecteively AI spam example](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/connecteively-ai-spam-example.png)

Although I was off to a bad start, looking through most of the responses afterward, these two were the only blatant automated pitches I could spot.

These responses weren’t included in my survey, and anyone who saw my pitch would have to copy and paste the survey link to complete it—increasing the chance of genuine human responses—hopefully.

So, without further ado, here are the results of the survey.

Yes, you read that right.

Expertise Finder also received no votes in my survey, but it was included as I saw it had been recommended as an HARO alternative on LinkedIn. It’s a platform that helps journalists find and connect with expert sources from universities.

## More ways to get expert quotes and backlinks

HARO had a dual purpose for SEOs: it was a place to acquire links, but it also was a place to get expert quotes on topics for your next article.

Here are a few more free methods outside the platforms we’ve covered that can help you get expert quotes and links.

### 1\. Follow X’s “request” hashtags

We’ve already seen that [JournoRequest](https://twitter.com/journo_request) is a popular X account that shares journalist requests for sources.

But you can also follow hashtags on X to access even more opportunities.

Here are my favorite hashtags to follow:

*   [#JournoRequest](https://twitter.com/hashtag/journorequest?src=hashtag_click)
*   [#PRrequest](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PRrequest&src=hashtag_click)
*   [#BloggerRequest](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bloggerrequest&src=typed_query&f=top)
*   [#Helpareporter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23helpareporter&src=typed_query&f=top)

I used to track the #journorequest hashtag to find opportunities for my clients when I worked agency-side, so I know it can work well for quotes and link acquisition.

Here are two opportunities I found just checking the #journorequest hashtag:

![Journorequest example for HuffPost US](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/journorequest-example-for-huffpost-us.png)

Here’s another example from the Telegraph—a DR 92 website:

![Telegraph example DR 92 website journorequest](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/telegraph-example-dr-92-website-journorequest.png)

### 2\. Create targeted content that naturally acquires links

Certain types of content are more likely to be shared by journalists and PRs than others.

One of these types of content is statistics-based content. The reason? Journalists often use statistics to support their points.

Once they have included your statistic in their post, they often add a backlink back to your post.

We tested this with our [SEO statistics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-statistics/) post, and as you can see, it still ranks number one in Google.

![SERP overview for SEO statistics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/serp-overview-for-seo-statistics.png)

### 3\. Use Ahrefs’ Linking authors report

Another method is to use the **Linking authors** report in Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer). This report shows the authors’ names who link to any website you enter.

You can see which authors link to their site by entering your competitor’s domain. Some of these authors may represent outreach opportunities for your website as well.

1.  Head to [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer), click on **Linking authors**
2.  Type in your competitor’s URL
3.  Contact any authors that you think may be interested in your website and its content

![Linking authors report, via Ahrefs.com](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/linking-authors-report-via-ahrefs-com.jpg)

Tip

If you download your website’s linking authors and your competitors into a spreadsheet and put them into separate tabs, you can compare the lists to see which authors are only linking to your competitor’s website.

### 4\. Check out Jolly SEO’s top three platforms

When I was about to wrap up this article, I was contacted by Greg Heilers of [Jolly SEO](https://jollyseo.com/) on LinkedIn.

He said he’d sent 200,000+ pitches over the years and wanted to share the results with me.

These are his last 1,000 wins he earned. Interestingly, we can see that it’s similar to my much smaller-scale survey.

![Jolly SEOs 1000 link placements
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jolly-seos-1000-link-placements.png)

Ordered by number of link placements. Average Domain Rating from Ahrefs. Average organic traffic from Ahrefs.

Hopefully, the data here speaks for itself. The high-quality links and traffic from HARO alternatives is considerable.

This research shows that Featured gained the most link placements in this campaign.

### 5\. Use Ahrefs’ link building resources

We have compiled some helpful content related to link building that you can get your teeth into. These hand-picked guides will take you from beginner to expert in no time.

Here are my favorite resources on this topic:

## Final thoughts

There are many options for sourcing expert quotes and getting links for your next marketing campaigns. [HARO may be dead](https://ahrefs.com/blog/rip-haro/), but its legacy lives on.

My highly unscientific survey suggests that most “new HARO” users liked [Help a B2B Writer](https://helpab2bwriter.com/) the most, but for HARO purists, there really is only one choice—[HERO](https://helpeveryreporter.com/).

Give your favorites from this list a whirl, and let me know if you have any success. Got more questions? Ping me [on X](https://twitter.com/chris_at_b449).
