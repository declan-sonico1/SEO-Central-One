# Brighton SEO Live Blog

Hello everyone. It’s April again, so I’m back in Brighton for another two days of

~sun~

, sea, and SEO!

Being the introvert I am, my idea of fun isn’t hanging around our booth all day explaining we’ve run out of t-shirts (seriously, you need to be fast if you want swag!). So I decided to do something useful and live-blog the event instead.

Follow below for talk takeaways and (very) mildly humorous commentary.
