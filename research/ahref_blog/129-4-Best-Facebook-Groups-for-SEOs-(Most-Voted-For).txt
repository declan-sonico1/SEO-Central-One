# 4 Best Facebook Groups for SEOs (Most Voted For)

Most SEO Facebook groups are riddled with spam. So we asked the 12,200 members of [Ahrefs Insider](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ahrefsinsider), our customer-only Facebook group, to vote for their favorites. 

![sq question ahrefs insider](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sq-question-ahrefs-insider.png)

Even though there were more than 20 suggestions and hundreds of votes, 85% went to just four groups.

Below, I’ll reveal what these groups were, and what I liked and disliked after joining them.

1.  [Affiliate SEO Mastermind](#affiliate-seo-mastermind)
2.  [SEO Signals Lab](#seo-signals-lab)
3.  [The Proper SEO Group](#the-proper-seo-group)
4.  [SEO Secrets by Detailed.com](#seo-secrets)

## 1\. Affiliate SEO Mastermind

![pasted image 0 41](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-41.jpg)

**Members:** 14,711  
**Owner:** Matt Diggity  
**Type:** [Private](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thelabresults)  
**Topics:** SEO, affiliate marketing  
**Number of votes:** 126

Owned and run by [Matt Diggity](https://www.facebook.com/matt.diggity.seo), a well-respected SEO in the affiliate marketing industry, Affiliate SEO Mastermind is a group dedicated to the mastery of [affiliate marketing](https://ahrefs.com/blog/affiliate-marketing/) using [SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-seo/).

The group is pretty active, with tons of affiliate SEOs asking questions every day. SEOs of every hat color are welcome.

Since it deals with affiliate marketing, vendor-and-service-related questions are frequent, as are posts related to the buying and selling of [affiliate sites](https://ahrefs.com/blog/amazon-affiliate-websites/).

![affiliate site for sale](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/affiliate-site-for-sale.png)

In short, it’s a fantastic group to be in if you are into website flipping.

Another thing I like about the group is how Matt helps members stay accountable with monthly goal-setting posts, where he holds people publicly responsible for the things they plan to execute.

And finally, since Matt is regularly available in the group, Affiliate SEO Mastermind is likely your best shot if you’ve always wanted to reach out to him.

## 2\. SEO Signals Lab

![seo signals lab](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/seo-signals-lab.jpg)

**Members:** 61,097  
**Owner:** Steven Kang  
**Type:** [Private](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SEOSignalsLab/)  
**Topics:** SEO, digital marketing  
**Number of votes:** 67

SEO Signals Lab is quite possibly the most active of all SEO Facebook groups. Ask any question, and you’ll likely get responses within 15-20 minutes.

The best part is: it’s not a group filled solely with beginners. There are lots of knowledgeable SEOs in there. That makes this group a great place for troubleshooting specific issues that you might struggle to find answers to in blog posts. You essentially get to crowdsource solutions to your particular problem from experienced SEOs.

[Steven](https://www.facebook.com/steven.kang.79), the owner, is also very active and encourages active discussion with regular thought-provoking questions. He typically does this by attaching a funny meme or GIF:

And this is, in my opinion, the ingredient that makes SEO Signals Lab a fantastic group. Yes, SEO is a serious business. But discussing it doesn’t have to be. Members appreciate a bit of fun and humor.

Steven also runs regular “Pick His/Her Brain” sessions where group members can pick an industry expert’s brain. Past SEO experts have included [Matt Diggity](https://twitter.com/mattdiggityseo), [Robbie Richards](https://twitter.com/RobbieRichMktg), [Jessica Foster](https://twitter.com/seocopychick), [Kevin Indig](https://twitter.com/Kevin_Indig), [Holly Starks](https://www.facebook.com/greeny1232), [Bill Slawski](https://twitter.com/bill_slawski), and many others.

## 3\. The Proper SEO Group

![pasted image 0 39](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-39.png)

**Members:** 28,760  
**Owner:** Gary Wilson  
**Type:** [Private](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheProperPBNGroup)  
**Topics:** SEO  
**Number of votes:** 21

Founded by Charles Floate, Todd Foster, and James Gregory, the Proper SEO Group (renamed from the Proper PBN Group) is now owned and run by [Gary Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/garywilsy).

However, the founding principles of the group remain the same. It’s a place for open-minded discussions of [SEO methods and techniques](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-techniques/). No matter what color hat you wear ([white](https://ahrefs.com/blog/white-hat-seo), [black](https://ahrefs.com/blog/black-hat-seo-tactics/), grey), you’re welcome to participate and ask questions.

The group is pretty active, and tons of questions get asked every day. There are also plenty of SEO services-related posts, so it’s an excellent group to join if you’re looking for professional SEO help.

## 4\. SEO Secrets by Detailed.com

![pasted image 0 40](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-40.png)

**Members:** 11,644  
**Owner:** Glen Allsopp  
**Type:** [Private](https://www.facebook.com/groups/detailedcom/)  
**Topics:** SEO  
**Number of votes:** 15

Compared to the others on this list, this group was formed relatively recently (2018). Yet it has quickly attracted tons of members, most likely due to Glen’s popularity as an SEO.

However, despite its name, there are no “secrets” shared in this group. Most posts are from members asking SEO-related questions, as is the case with most SEO groups.

It is also pretty inactive, and Glen appears infrequently. Yet, despite that, members of Ahrefs Insider still rate this group highly. Perhaps this is a case of quality over quantity? Or maybe SEOs just have faith in a group curated by Glen, a well-respected SEO.

Bottom line: SEO Secrets is undoubtedly worth joining, even if only for the occasional update or insight from Glen himself. But it’s unlikely to be your first port of call if you want a question answered quickly.

Unless you want a newsfeed filled almost entirely with posts from SEO groups, four groups are almost certainly enough. But the participants of our poll did vouch for a few others, so here are the remaining ones with three or more votes.

1.  **[Women in Tech SEO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/techseowomen) (6 votes):** Sorry, guys. This one isn’t for you. It’s a place for women to discuss, share, and learn more about technical SEO.
2.  **[Niche Affiliate Empires](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nicheaffiliateempires) (4 votes):** Owned by Gareth Daine, this is the companion group to Gareth’s public case study where he’s attempting to build a successful affiliate website.
3.  **[Local Client Takeover](https://www.facebook.com/groups/localclienttakeover/) (4 votes):** As the name suggests, this group focuses on [local SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/local-seo/) strategies, like Google My Business and Google Maps optimization.
4.  **[Superstar SEO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/superstarseo/) (4 votes):** Both a community and an agency, Superstar SEO focuses on building a successful SEO agency.
5.  **[Marketing Cheat Guides](https://www.facebook.com/groups/seocheatguides/) (3 votes):** Originally known as “SEO Cheat Guides,” this group now focuses on teaching digital marketers how to build their dream business.
6.  **[Sisters in SEO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sistersinseo) (3 votes):** Another all-women group that aims to help SEOs improve their skills, share successes and challenges, and network with each other.

## Final thoughts

Is this list exhaustive?

No, it isn’t. But that’s a good thing, and something we did on purpose.

If you’re working in SEO (or [digital marketing](https://ahrefs.com/blog/digital-marketing-strategies/)), execution is what matters. You don’t want to join too many groups and end up procrastinating on Facebook all day. My advice is to join one group that most appeals to you. If you find that you’re not getting the answers you need, quit and join a different one.

Finally, remember that if you’re an Ahrefs user, you can also join our customers-only Facebook group, [Ahrefs Insider](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ahrefsinsider/). If you have any questions about [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), SEO, or digital marketing, you can always find answers in the group. It’s pretty active.
