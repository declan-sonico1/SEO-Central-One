# 100 Blog Post Ideas to Get Traffic

It’s easy to come up with blog post ideas, but writing about random topics won’t get you traffic to your blog.

You need to write about topics with traffic potential.

## How to find blog post ideas with traffic potential

The proverb goes, “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.”

If you know how to find blog post ideas on your own, you’ll always be able to find relevant topics with search traffic potential.

Here are two ways to do that:

### 1\. Do keyword research

Keyword research is where you find the words and phrases your target audience is typing into Google. The easiest way to start is to use a keyword research tool like Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer).

Just enter a relevant topic, go to the **Matching terms** report, switch the toggle to **Questions**, and you’ll get tens of thousands of potential keyword ideas:

If the list is too large, you can narrow it down using a **Keyword Difficulty (KD)** filter and a **Traffic Potential (TP)** filter to focus on high-traffic, low-competition keywords. Just set the max KD filter to a low number like 20 and the TP filter to a minimum of something like 500:

If you want to refine the list even further to keywords more likely to be within your wheelhouse, set the “Lowest DR” filter to your website’s [Domain Rating (DR)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) score (find this by plugging your domain into [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer)). You will then see only keywords that websites of similar “authority” rank for.

### 2\. Learn from your competitors

If you have competitors, they’re likely already ranking for many keywords on Google. You can see what they’re ranking for and target the same topics, too.

Here’s how:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer)
2.  Enter your competitor’s domain
3.  Go to **Top pages**

![Top pages report in Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/top-pages-report-in-site-explorer.jpg)

This report shows the pages generating the most search traffic for your competitor. For example, Beardbrand’s post on beard styles gets an estimated 69,000 monthly search visits. Out of the 9,542 keywords it ranks for, “beard styles” sends the most traffic.

If you’re competing with Beardbrand, this could be a good topic to write about.
