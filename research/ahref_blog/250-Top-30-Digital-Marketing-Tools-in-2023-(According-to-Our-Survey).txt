# Top 30 Digital Marketing Tools in 2023 (According to Our Survey)

We asked [Ahrefs’ Digest](https://ahrefs.com/newsletter) newsletter subscribers one simple question: “What digital marketing tools are you using in 2023?”

Here are the results.

Sidenote.

This was a multiple choice survey, so respondents could vote for all the tools they use in each category. We put together the initial tools list ourselves, but the survey also allowed people to tell us about any other tools they use (which they did).

## SEO tools

![Top SEO tools](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/top-seo-tools.png)

### 1\. [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)

Google Search Console (GSC) is an SEO tool that helps you to:

*   Understand how Google sees your pages.
*   Analyze clicks, impressions, and average position.
*   See which queries bring users to your site.
*   Find and fix [technical SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/technical-seo/) errors.
*   Get your content on Google by [submitting sitemaps](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-create-a-sitemap/).

GSC’s popularity among SEOs and marketers is just one of the reasons we decided to integrate GSC into Ahrefs’ [Rank Tracker](https://ahrefs.com/rank-tracker) and our free tool: [Ahrefs Webmaster Tools](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools).  

### 2\. [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)

Ahrefs is an SEO toolset you can use to optimize your website and improve your rankings in search engines like Google. 

It’s especially useful for the following SEO tasks:

You can try Ahrefs for free by signing up for [Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (AWT)](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools). Connecting your website to [AWT](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools) enables you to audit and track the SEO performance of your website. 

Editor’s Note

There’s no doubt that Ahrefs is a popular tool. It consistently ranks top in industry polls (see [our “vs” page](https://ahrefs.com/vs)). But our popularity here is probably a little overstated as we surveyed our own subscribers, many of who are obviously Ahrefs customers. So yeah, we just wanted to be transparent about that.
