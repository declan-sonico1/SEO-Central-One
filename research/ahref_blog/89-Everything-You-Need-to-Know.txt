# Everything You Need to Know

According to [Aira’s State of Link Building report](https://aira.net/state-of-link-building/link-building-techniques-and-tools/), guest blogging is the third most popular link building strategy, with 47% of surveyed SEOs using it as their go-to. 

![Guest blogging is the third most popular link building strategy, according to Aira’s State of Link Building report](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image19-11.png)

Not only is guest posting well and alive, it’s still highly effective. In this post, you’ll learn everything you need to know about guest blogging. 

But first, let’s make sure we’re on the same page.

## What is guest blogging?

Guest blogging is the practice of writing and publishing a blog post on another person or company’s website. Most guest bloggers receive credit for their post (and a link to their website) in their author byline.

For example, I wrote a [guest post for Grow & Convert](https://www.growandconvert.com/marketing/reddit-marketing/) several years ago:

![SQ's guest post for Grow & Convert](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image7-16.png)

## What are the benefits of guest blogging?

Guest blogging is a win-win for both the guest blogger and the blog owner.

Benefits for the writer:

*   Build links back to their own blog or site
*   Develop relationships with editors and blog owners
*   Expose their brand to a new audience
*   Build their reputation and position themselves as a thought leader

Benefit for the site owner:

*   Leverage the expertise and experience of guest bloggers. For example, we published guest posts from [Zapier](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zapier-content-marketing/) and [Pet Keen](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building-methods/). We couldn’t have written about their firsthand SEO experience without guest writers.

## How to start guest blogging

Getting your first guest post published can be daunting. I’ve been there. The steps below will make the process easier and maximize your chances of success.

Follow this guest blogging strategy:

### 1\. Find guest blogging opportunities

To find guest posting opportunities, most people use [Google search operators](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) to find blogs with “write for us” pages. However, if everyone’s following this tactic, then everyone’s finding the same opportunities. Competition will be rife, and guest blogs may ignore your pitch. 

You don’t have to limit yourself to this small pool of blogs. Even if they do not advertise it, most blogs will accept guest posts as long as it’s a wonderful article.

So here’s how to find relevant, high quality sites to pitch:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer)
2.  Enter a broad keyword or phrase related to your niche
3.  Select **In title** from the drop-down menu
4.  Run the search

![Finding guest post opportunities using Ahrefs' Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-17.png)

Here, you can see more than 2 million potential opportunities. That’s too many, so let’s narrow the list down by applying these filters:

1.  [**Domain Rating (DR)**](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) from 30 to 60
2.  Click the **One page per domain** filter
3.  Click the **Exclude homepages** filter
4.  Click the **Exclude subdomains** filter

![Narrowing down Content Explorer's results using filters
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-14.jpg)

Then click on the **Websites** tab. 

![Using the "Websites" tab to find the best guest blogging opportunities
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image29-5.png)

These are the potential websites you could guest blog for.

### 2\. Develop guest post ideas

The blogs you pitch will want winning content ideas. So how can you come up with good guest post ideas? 

Here are some techniques you can use:

#### Copycat Technique

Three things are true:

1.  Every blog wants more search traffic.
2.  To get search traffic, you need to do keyword research and target topics people are searching for.
3.  Every blog has more topics to write than resources to cover them.

So why not help your target blogs out? Find topics they should be ranking for and pitch them those topics.

Here’s how to find them:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Competitive Analysis tool](https://app.ahrefs.com/competitive-analysis)
2.  Enter the domain of your target blog in the **Target** section
3.  Add the first three suggested competing domains in the **Competitors** section
4.  Click **Compare**

![Ahrefs' Competitive Analysis tool
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image33-6.png)

![Finding content gaps you could cover for your target blog
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-13.png)

This report shows you the keywords the competing domains are ranking for, but your target blog isn’t. 

Go through the report and look for keywords that are relevant to your target blog. For example, this seems like a potential topic to pitch:

![Potential guest post topic to pitch DietDoctor
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image2-17.png)

#### Refresh Technique

Refreshing outdated content can provide a huge traffic boost, as seen when we updated our [post about free SEO tools](https://ahrefs.com/blog/free-seo-tools/):

![A boost in search traffic after an update
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image11-12.png)

Your target blog will likely have outdated content that has declined in search traffic. Pitch them an update.

> What if..
> 
> ..instead of reaching out with an offer to write a guest post for someone…
> 
> ..you would find their old and outdated post that dipped in search traffic and offer them to rewrite it?
> 
>

Here’s how to find pages with declining traffic:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer)
2.  Enter the domain of your target blog
3.  Go to the **Top pages** report
4.  Set the **Compare** filter to **Previous year**
5.  Sort the **Traffic change** column from lowest to highest

![Using Ahrefs' Site Explorer to find declines in traffic for your target blog so you can pitch it an update
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image22-4.png)

This will show you pages on your target blog that have the largest decline in search traffic since the previous year. Go through the report and look out for suitable topics, especially those with declines in traffic and keyword positions.

For example, SmartBlogger’s post on membership sites has dropped in both keyword positions and search traffic:

![SmartBlogger’s post on membership sites has dropped in both keyword positions and search traffic
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image16-10.png)

If you were writing for SmartBlogger, this would be a good topic to pitch.

#### Robin Hood Technique

Popular blogs are popular for one reason: They have [great content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-write-great-content/). Lesser-known blogs are lesser-known for the opposite reason: They have _yet_ to publish tons of great content.

So why not take content ideas from the top blogs and offer them to lesser-known ones? 

We call this the **Robin Hood Technique,** named after the English folk hero who stole from the rich and gave to the poor.

Here’s how to execute the Robin Hood Technique:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer)
2.  Enter the domain of a high-DR blog in your niche
3.  Go to the **Top pages** report
4.  Toggle **SERP titles** on

![Finding opportunities to gain topic inspiration from, via Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image31-6.png)

Look through the report and see if there is any idea that resonates. Put a unique spin and pitch it to a lesser-known blog.

For example, if you’re writing for a personal finance blog, this seems like a good topic to be inspired by:

![Potential topic to pitch a personal finance blog
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image13-13.png)

A potential idea to pitch can be “free (or cheap) things to do on a date.”

#### Splintering Technique

Our [link building guide](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building/) is so comprehensive it spans five chapters:

![Table of contents for our link building guide
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image24-5.png)

Each chapter could be a post on its own. 

So we can break this post into “splinters” and create standalone articles. Each of these splintered articles can be pitched as a guest post.

![The Splintering Technique
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image23-5.jpg)

Since we already did the research by creating the original piece, the “splintered” articles would likely not take much time to write. 

#### Perspective Technique

You can easily reuse a topic by switching up the perspective. 

For example, let’s say we wrote a guest post titled “Best Remote Jobs for Students.” We can cover the same topic for different publications via multiple perspectives:

![The Perspective Technique](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/guest-blogging-1-1.png)

### 3\. Pitch the blogs

This step is both the easiest and the most nerve-wracking. It’s easy because it’s simply an email you send. It’s nerve-wracking because your fate is in the other party’s hands.

It doesn’t have to be _that_ anxiety-inducing, though. Here are some tips to improve your chances of getting your pitch accepted:

#### Read the guest posting guidelines

If the site you’re pitching has a guest post submission page, read and follow the blog’s guest post guidelines**.** For example, this is what CoSchedule expects:

![CoSchedule's guest post guidelines
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image6-13.png)

#### Find the correct email

If the publication has a “write for us” page, then it’s likely it’ll provide either an email address or a form. 

![How to submit a guest post pitch to CoSchedule's blog
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image21-6.png)

Otherwise, you’ll need to find it.

Publications and blogs are typically managed by a managing editor, head of content or, if they’re a small site, the website owner themself. So you want to first make sure you identify who that person is. 

You can usually find them by visiting the “teams” or “about” page. For example, a quick scroll on our [“team” page](https://ahrefs.com/team) shows you should pitch to our head of content, Joshua Hardwick:

![Joshua Hardwick's bio on our "team" page
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image15-11.jpg)

If the “team” page is uninformative, then a search on LinkedIn or Twitter usually suffices.

![Searching for our head of content on LinkedIn
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image14-6.png)

![Searching for our head of content on Twitter
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image30-5.png)

Once you’ve identified that person, use an email discovery tool like Hunter to find their email. Add their name and website, and Hunter will do its magic:

![Finding Joshua Hardwick's email on Hunter
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image8-12.png)

#### Write an amazing outreach email

Several years ago, I guest posted for Grow & Convert. Benji Hyam, the co-founder, was so impressed with my outreach email that he did an analysis.

Publications get **a lot** of emails. You have to stand out; otherwise, your email will be ignored.

> About to publish the 1st guest post on our site since March 2016. In the last 1.5yrs we’ve had 100s of guests posts requests & 1 good pitch.
> 
> — Benji Hyam (@benjihyam) [November 7, 2017](https://twitter.com/benjihyam/status/927703945211920384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Rather than look for a template that you can copy-paste, you want to understand the principles behind what makes a good outreach email.

You can look at Benji’s analysis of my email to see what publications are expecting. You’d also do well to read the post below and follow the principles it lays out.

### 4\. Write your guest post

If your pitch is accepted, then it’s time to write.

I recommend starting first with the [outline](https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-outline/). Some sites may request this. But even if they don’t, an outline will help flesh out your thoughts, organize the post, and prevent blank page syndrome. 

To create an outline, you need to know what subtopics to cover. The easiest way to find these subtopics is to look at the common keyword rankings among top-ranking pages and eyeball the list for subtopics.

Here’s how:

1.  Enter your target keyword into Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Scroll down to the **SERP overview**
3.  Select the top-ranking pages you want to analyze
4.  Click **Open in** and choose **Content gap**

![Open in Content gap, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image25-8.png)

For example, if we analyze the topic “affiliate marketing,” we’ll see that the top-ranking pages also rank for:

*   what is affiliate marketing
*   how to become an affiliate marketer
*   how to do affiliate marketing

![Common keyword rankings for the top-ranking posts for "affiliate marketing"
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image26-5.png)

These would make good H2s for a blog post on “affiliate marketing.”

Once you’ve created your outline, all that’s left is to fill in the “gaps,” i.e., write the guest post. If they have one, make sure you go back to the guidelines, read it carefully, and follow it to a T.

![CoSchedule's editorial guidelines
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image18-12.png)

Where relevant, don’t forget to include links back to your own blog. Don’t overdo it, though; one to two links to your own content should suffice.

### 5\. Promote your guest post

You should expect some back-and-forth as the publisher edits and sends feedback about your draft. Once they’re satisfied, they’ll inform you of a publishing date.

Congratulations, you’re a guest writer now!

![SmartBlogger's editor letting SQ know when the guest post will be published
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image20-11.png)

Don’t just disappear when the guest post is published. Follow up! Thank the editor. And if there’s a comment section, stay around and reply.

![SQ's thank-you email to the editor of SmartBlogger
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image10-12.png)

![SQ staying around to reply to comments after his guest post was published
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image1-12.png)

Help promote the post by sharing it on social media too:

You can even go the extra mile by promoting the post in relevant communities. In my case, Benji did it for me by submitting it to GrowthHackers. But I stayed around to answer comments.

![SQ staying around to answer comments after the guest post was posted on GrowthHackers
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image28-4.png)

It was likely the reason why it got so much engagement:

![SQ's guest post got a ton of upvotes and engagement on GrowthHackers
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image27-5.png)

It was even the #2 post in that year’s year-end roundup: 

## Guest blogging tips

Everything above will get you 90% of the way. But guest blogging is not a bed of roses. So I’m sharing the tips below to help you overcome some of the common roadblocks.

### 1\. Pitch more blogs than you can handle

The cruel reality of guest blogging is that even if they’re good, your guest blogging efforts can be rejected or ignored. That’s no fault of yours—publications are just too busy.

So here’s a controversial tip: pitch the same topics to multiple blogs. Then offer the article to whoever replies first or has a higher authority (if you get lots of replies).

This way, you’re never lacking for guest posts. You won’t even need to be worried about rejection, for there will be another blog willing to accept your guest posts.

If you get more than one reply, simply tell the truth:

> Sorry, you weren’t responding for a few days, so another blog took this idea. I’ll be in touch with more article ideas that’ll be just as good.

### 2\. Write for blogs that have never linked to you before

Our [study of 1 billion pages](https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/) shows a strong correlation between organic traffic and the number of backlinks from unique websites (referring domains).

![Chart showing the correlation between search traffic and referring domains
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/guest-blogging-2.png)

That may be one reason why you want to write for blogs that have never linked to you before.

To find unique websites, hit the **Highlight unlinked** dropdown and add your website as you’re following step #1:

## FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about guest blogging:

### How does guest blogging help SEO?

Links [are](https://searchengineland.com/now-know-googles-top-three-search-ranking-factors-245882) an important [Google ranking factor](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-ranking-factors/). By writing a guest post, you can build links back to your pages and, therefore, boost their performance in search engines.

### Is guest blogging bad for SEO?

In 2014, Google’s former head of web spam, [Matt Cutts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cutts), published a [blog post](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/) proclaiming that “guest blogging is done.” However, he was primarily referring to low-quality guest blogging published on low-quality sites for links. 

Writing a valuable blog post for an established site with a relevant audience will still help your SEO and is unlikely to hurt it.

### Can I get referral traffic from guest blogging?

Several years ago, our chief marketing officer, [Tim Soulo](https://twitter.com/timsoulo?lang=en), asked 500+ bloggers how much traffic they got from their guest articles.

![Average referral traffic from a guest article](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/guest-blogging-3.png)

The average referral traffic across 239 guest articles was only 50 visits.

So yes, you can get referral traffic from guest blogging—but don’t set your expectations too high.
