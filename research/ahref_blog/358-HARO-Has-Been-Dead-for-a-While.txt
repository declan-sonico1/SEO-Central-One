~link-building~

collaboration tool, HARO, was officially killed off for good last week by Cision. It’s now been wrapped into a new product: [Connectively](https://www.connectively.us/).

I know nothing about the new tool. I haven’t tried it. But after trying to use HARO recently, I can’t say I’m surprised or saddened by its death. It’s been a walking corpse for a while. 

## My experience with HARO: “Great… More AI spam!”

I used HARO way back in the day to build links. It worked. But a couple of months ago, I experienced the platform from the other side when I decided to try to source some “expert” insights for our posts. 

After just a few minutes of work, I got hundreds of pitches: 

![Hundreds of pitches I received from just three HARO requests](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hundreds-of-pitches-i-received-from-just-three-har.png)

So, I grabbed a cup of coffee and began to work through them. It didn’t take long before I lost the will to live. Every other pitch seemed like nothing more than lazy AI-generated nonsense from someone who _definitely_ wasn’t an expert. 

Here’s one of them:

Seriously. Who writes like that? I’m a self-confessed dullard (any fellow [Dull Men’s Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dullmensclub/) members here?), and even I’m not _that_ dull… 

I don’t think I looked through more than 30-40 of the responses. I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. It felt like having a conversation with ChatGPT… and not a very good one! 

## Marketers ruin everything. HARO is no exception

Despite only reviewing a few dozen of the many pitches I received, one stood out to me: 

![Example HARO pitch that caught my attention](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/example-haro-pitch-that-caught-my-attention.jpg)

Believe it or not, this response came from a past client of mine who runs an SEO agency in the UK. Given how knowledgeable and experienced he is (he actually taught me a lot about SEO back in the day when I used to hassle him with questions on Skype), this pitch rang alarm bells for two reasons: 

1.  I truly doubt he spends his time replying to HARO queries
2.  I know for a fact he’s no fan of Neil Patel (sorry, Neil, but I’m sure you’re aware of your reputation at this point!)

So… I decided to confront him  

Here’s what he said: 

![Hunch, confirmed ;)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hunch-confirmed.png)

Shocker. 

I pressed him for more details: 

> I’m getting a really good deal and paying per link rather than the typical £xxxx per month for X number of pitches. \[…\] The responses as you’ve seen are not ideal but that’s a risk I’m prepared to take as realistically I dont have the time to do it myself. He’s not native english, but I have had to have a word with him a few times about clearly using AI. On the low cost ones I don’t care but on authority sites it needs to be more refined.

I think this pretty much sums up the state of HARO before its death. Most “pitches” were just AI answers from SEOs trying to build links for their clients. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not throwing shade here. I know that good links are hard to come by, so you have to do what works. And the reality is that HARO _did_ work. Just look at the example below. You can tell from the anchor and surrounding text in Ahrefs that these links were almost certainly built with HARO: 

![Example of links build with HARO, via Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/example-of-links-build-with-haro-via-ahrefs-site.png)

But this was the problem. HARO worked so well back in the day that it was only a matter of time before spammers and the #scale crew ruined it for everyone. That’s what happened, and now HARO is no more. So… 

## What now?

**If you’re a link builder**, I think it’s time to admit that HARO link building is dead and move on. 

No tactic works well forever. It’s [the law of sh\*\*ty clickthroughs](https://andrewchen.com/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/). This is why you don’t see SEOs having huge success with tactics like [broken link building](https://ahrefs.com/blog/broken-link-building/) anymore. They’ve moved on to [more innovative tactics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building-case-study/) or, dare I say it, are just [buying links](https://ahrefs.com/blog/buy-backlinks/).

Sidenote.

Talking of buying links, here’s something to ponder: if Connectively charges for pitches, are links built through those pitches technically paid? If so, do they violate [Google’s spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies)? It’s a murky old world this SEO lark, eh?

**If you’re a journalist**, Connectively might be worth a shot. But with experts being charged for pitches, you probably won’t get as many responses. That might be a good thing. You might get less spam. Or you might just get spammed by SEOs with deep pockets. The jury’s out for now. 

My advice? Look for alternative methods like finding and reaching out to experts directly. You can easily use tools like [Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer) to find folks who’ve written lots of content about the topic and are likely to be experts. 

For example, if you look for content with “backlinks” in the title and go to the Authors tab, you might see a familiar name.  

![Finding people to request insights from in Ahrefs' Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/finding-people-to-request-insights-from-in-ahrefs.png)

I don’t know if I’d call myself an expert, but I’d be happy to give you a quote if you reached out on social media or emailed me (here’s [how to find my email address](https://ahrefs.com/blog/find-email-address/)).

Alternatively, you can bait your audience into giving you their insights on social media. I did this recently with a poll on X and included many of the responses in [my guide to toxic backlinks](https://ahrefs.com/blog/toxic-backlinks/).

Either of these options is quicker than using HARO because you don’t have to sift through hundreds of responses looking for a needle in a haystack. If you disagree with me and still love HARO, feel free to [tell me why on X](https://twitter.com/joshuachardwick?lang=en)
