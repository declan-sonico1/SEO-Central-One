I’m obviously biased towards Ahrefs, but we’re really in a league of our own with 44% of the S&P 500 choosing us. Look how we compare to other enterprise SEO tools in the market.

And our organic search [share of voice (SoV)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/share-of-voice/).

Website Organic Search Traffic - 2.5M

This is obviously our top pick, but it deserves to be. Don’t just take our word for it. Ask around and see who comes up as the platform of choice for SEOs. [See who real users favor](https://ahrefs.com/vs).

### Why Ahrefs is the right choice

We’re the favorite tool for [enterprise SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/enterprise-seo/) teams. We epitomize [big data](https://ahrefs.com/big-data). 

![Ahrefs has more data than other enterprise seo tools](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ahrefs-data-size-385x425.png)

For some context, Google’s index is around 100 PB. We store over 7x that amount. 

You’ll see these differences between us and competitors in the platform itself. We’re extremely fast and have granular data that no one else has.

We also have the 34th fastest supercomputer in the world! This lets us do more with machine learning and AI than most companies on the planet. 

![Ahrefs has the 34th fastest supercomputer in the world](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ahrefs-fastest-supercomputer-411x425.jpg)

We [crawl faster](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots) than any other SEO tool, according to Cloudflare Radar. 

![Image showing AhrefsBot as the fourth-fastest crawler on the web, according to Cloudflare Radar
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-cloudflare-radar.png)

We’re the [best backlink checker](https://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/seo/tools/best-backlink-checker/), according to Matthew Woodward’s test of 1 million domains. We’re the only SEO tool that will pick up links added with JavaScript for our backlink index because we’re the only one that renders pages while crawling the web.

On top of that, we’re the only SEO platform that is fed data from [IndexNow](https://ahrefs.com/blog/indexnow-yep-ahrefs/) which is a data submission partnership used by search engines. 60 million sites are feeding us 2.5 billion new and updated pages per day. 

For links and pages, that means we have the largest and freshest data.

We have the largest keyword database with 74B keywords that we filter to remove noise, because we also care about the quality of data shown to users. 

We have the [most accurate traffic estimates](https://www.authorityhacker.com/traffic-estimates-accuracy/), according to Authority Hacker. For keywords where we have enough data, we use individually model click-through rate (CTR) curves rather than using a single generic model for the curves.

We’re constantly adding to the product. We made [130+ product updates in 2023](https://ahrefs.com/blog/best-new-ahrefs-features-2023/). You can find many of our upcoming product updates on our [pricing page](https://ahrefs.com/pricing), including an always-on version of Site Audit, some forecasting options, the ability to import historical data for keywords in Rank Tracker, a cutting edge content tool, some more reporting capabilities, and a system called Patches that will solve SEO issues at scale.

There are also our industry-leading [articles](https://ahrefs.com/blog/), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/AhrefsCom), and [courses](https://ahrefs.com/academy). These resources will educate you on SEO and show you how to make the best use of the platform.

### Ahrefs features you’ll love

We have a lot of features that enterprise SEOs love.

#### Opportunities reports

Knowing what to prioritize is the hardest part of SEO. We created the **Opportunities** report to help SEOs work on things that will move the needle. If you’re not sure where to start, look at these reports and measure progress towards the opportunities shown and you will likely show a lot of success to your stakeholders. This report is a great starting point for an [enterprise SEO audit](https://ahrefs.com/blog/enterprise-seo-audit/).

![Opportunities report in Site Explorer shows the biggest opportunities to improve your SEO performance](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/opportunities-report-in-site-explorer-shows-the-bi.jpg)

You could also work with the in-house team or the dev team if you are in-house to create a visualization of what you consider the most important and impactful SEO projects. I normally use an impact / effort matrix for this to show how hard projects are and their estimated impact. Based on their coordinates, it’s easy to see which projects you should prioritize.

![Use an impact / effort matrix to help you prioritize your SEO projects](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/enterprise-seo-metrics-reporting.png)

#### Market views

For a high-level overview of the competitor landscape that is visually appealing, check out the [**Organic Competitors**](https://ahrefs.com/academy/how-to-use-ahrefs/v2-site-explorer/organic-competitors) report in Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer). This shows you three different metrics at a glance including Organic Traffic Value, Organic Traffic, and the number of pages on the site. You can also use a list of custom sites for the visualization if there are certain competitors you want to show.

![Market landscape via of competitors, via the Organic Competitors report in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/market-landscape-via-of-competitors-via-the-organ.png)

You can add a date comparison such as this year vs. last year to show how the market has evolved over a period of time.

![Market landscape via of competitors with date comparison, via the Organic Competitors report in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/market-landscape-via-of-competitors-with-date-comp.png)

The report will also work with more than just domains. You can plug in a specific website path or page if you’re reporting to a particular group or product team and need a more narrow view.

We also have charts for Share of Voice (SoV) & Share of Traffic Value (SoTV). SoTV is unique to Ahrefs. It’s more of a money metric, tied to the paid search cost of organic traffic.

![enterprise seo tools share of voice](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/enterprise-seo-tools-share-of-voice-680x299.png)

#### Portfolios

Now, you can group a list of up to 1000 URLs from up to 10 unique domains and track them as a single project to see their aggregated metrics in Site Explorer.

If you want to segment a site, or track multiple sites and research as if they were one, you can.

You can use it to:

*   **Track your top competitors as a single entity** to gain insight into how your industry is doing as a whole in terms of search traffic, how it’s coping with major Google algorithm updates, how it compares to other industries, and so on.
*   **Combine multiple “regional” domains** to track their performance as a single entity.
*   **Create author-specific portfolios** if you have multiple authors publishing content on your website. This lets you see which authors are bringing the most search traffic and backlinks, which ones have a higher publishing pace, and so on.
*   **Set up client portfolios** to create focused reports showing how your portfolio of content on their website has been performing.
*   **Create sets of pages for testing on-page SEO tactics**. Just set up a portfolio of the pages you’re implementing these tactics on, and track it against a second portfolio of pages in your control group.
*   **Do rank tracking on steroids** – no need to manually track hundreds of keywords per page when you can create a portfolio of pages, and be shown the thousands of keywords that they rank for.

#### Enterprise SEO scorecards

SEO scorecards let you monitor performance and compare one group to another or one section of a site to another.

Our [Site Structure](https://ahrefs.com/academy/how-to-use-ahrefs/v2-site-explorer/site-structure) report in Site Explorer has a lot of the information you’d use to create this scorecard view. You can even compare between two dates.

The columns are customizable so you can show only the metrics you need. We have Referring Pages, Referring Domains, Organic Traffic, Traffic Value, Organic Keywords, and Organic Pages available.

![The Site Structure report in Ahrefs' Site Explorer has many SEO metrics you'd find on an enterprise SEO scorecard](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-site-structure-report-in-ahrefs-site-explorer.png)

You can pull technical issues from [Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/site-audit) where you might want to show health scores over time for different sections of the site, [Core Web Vitals](https://ahrefs.com/blog/core-web-vitals/), or general errors. In the past, I’ve created views that showed the number of pages we still need to redirect, Core Web Vitals scoring, and pages that have too many redirect hops.

![CrUX performance dashboard via Ahrefs' Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crux-performance-dashboard-via-ahrefs-site-audit.png)

You can also create custom groupings of pages using our Portfolios feature. If you have a business unit or product offering that owns some pages on the blog, some pages in the product section, some pages in support, etc., then you can add them as a Portfolio to get a rolled up view. Portfolios support up to 10 different domains and 1,000 different pages or paths.

#### Your GSC data, but better

With the GSC Overview report, your team can analyze your Google Search Console property and see the distribution of clicks, impressions, and CTR by position right in Rank Tracker. We store the full history, from the time you connect the data.

![GSC integration in Ahrefs' Rank Tracker](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image15-4.png)

If you’re doing opportunity forecasting to sell content creation initiatives, you’ll find our custom CTR curve models handy. They’re based on your own Google Search Console (GSC) data.

![Custom CTR curve based on GSC data
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/custom-ctr-curve-based-on-gsc-data.png)

We also have 

*   Top keywords
*   Top keyword changes
*   Low hanging fruit keywords, which shows you the most popular keywords where your target’s ranking position is between 4 and 15
*   Potential cannibalization, which shows you keywords with multiple ranking URLs
*   Top pages
*   Top page changes

![New widgets in GSC Overview report](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image5.png)

#### Content opportunities

You can use the [Content Gap](https://ahrefs.com/content-gap) tool to find these opportunities, but you may see some repeated opportunities because of similar keywords. We will update this to add clustering and help reduce this extra noise.

![Content Gap report in Ahrefs' Competitive Analysis tool](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/content-gap-report-in-ahrefs-competitive-analysis.png)

For now, you may want to export the keywords from the Content Gap tool and paste them into [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer). Then go to the “Clusters by Parent Topic” tab. This should give you actual content opportunities you may not be covering.

![Clusters by Parent Topic via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clusters-by-parent-topic-via-ahrefs-keywords-expl.png)

You can take these opportunities and the total volume of the clusters to use in your forecasts to come up with more accurate forecasts than those that use just one term per page. You could also just look at our Traffic Potential (TP) metric to get an idea of how much traffic a page might get.

#### AI Content Grader tool

Just enter your URL and its target keyword, and Content Grader will:

1.  Take the top 3 articles ranking for that keyword and identify the core topics covered in those articles
2.  Analyze how well your article and the top articles cover each topic
3.  Identify the topics that your article has lower scores for
4.  Show suggestions on how to improve your content to get better results

![Ahrefs' AI Content Grader ](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-content-grader.gif)

#### Find internal link opportunities

Our **Internal link opportunities** report identifies internal link opportunities by taking the top 10 keywords for your ranking pages—then finding mentions of them on your other pages. 

Including important keyword metrics and the keyword context. How cool is that?

![Internal link opportunities report, via Ahrefs' Site Audit
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image16-4-1.jpg)

TIP: Find internal link opportunities manually

We won’t suggest a link if one already exists between the pages.

Despite this, you can still find the pages mentioning your terms by going to the **Page explorer** report and searching for the keyword within the HTML feature.

![Page explorer report, via Ahrefs' Site Audit
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image3-7.png)

#### Search intent

You can use the “Identify intents” feature in [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer) to show the main intent of each term and the percentage of traffic to each intent. This helps you identify content angles or ways you can position your content to maximize traffic or if you’re even targeting the right things.

![Identify intents feature in Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/identify-intents-feature-in-ahrefs-keywords-explo.png)

#### Granular keyword data

On the Overview report in Keywords Explorer, you’ll find things like the distribution of paid/organic, mobile/desktop split, the distribution across search type like web, image, video, or news.

These help you understand the format searchers prefer.

![Search type distribution stats in Keywords Explorer Overview](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image9.png)

#### Competition monitoring

You can add competitors on the dashboard to keep an eye on their overall stats and how you compare. This is useful for creating competitor scorecards.

![Competitor SEO scorecard, via the Dashboard in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/competitor-seo-scorecard-via-the-dashboard-in-ahr.png)

You can use [Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer) to keep an eye on your competitors’ newly-published pages and pages that they have updated.

![Content Explorer showing new and republished competitor content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/content-explorer-showing-new-and-republished-compe.png)

If you create a [Portfolio](https://ahrefs.com/blog/portfolios/) on the Dashboard that includes competing websites, you end up with some pretty interesting views in other reports. For instance, you can get winners and losers for pages and keywords across all of your monitored competitors.

![Top winners and losers for competing pages, via the Dashboard in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/top-winners-and-losers-for-competing-pages-via-th.png)

You can also see new and lost pages and keywords to see what is working well for your competitors and what they’re getting rid of.

![New and lost competitor pages, via the Dashboard in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/new-and-lost-competitor-pages-via-the-dashboard-i.png)

Page inspect shows you the history of page changes over time. The darker the color, the more content changes were made on a page that day.

For example, this square on Jan 8 is a deep green. Clicking it shows you the exact things that have changed on this page – in this case, a huge content update.

![Calendar view in Page inspect](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20542%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

#### YoY trends

You can also look at YoY trends for your own site. You may want to use your GSC or analytics data if you have it, but GSC is typically limited to 16 months of data. If you’ve connected it to Ahrefs though, we store and show a longer period of time and you’ll eventually be able to show the YoY data for this for multiple years.

You can also use the Years tab in Overview along with average volume to show general trends or issues. We show trends for Organic Traffic Value, Organic Traffic, Referring Domains, Domain Rating, URL Rating, Organic Pages, and Crawled pages.

![YoY trended view for various SEO metrics, via the Overview in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/yoy-trended-view-for-various-seo-metrics-via-the.jpg)

#### Critical page and keyword monitoring

Enterprise companies will typically have some kind of top pages or top keywords project. These look at the most critical pages and/or keywords for your business and help you see their performance over time and any trends or issues.

They’re typically used in meetings where there is a quick analysis and an action plan created for any issues or for any successes. You try to look at what worked well so you can replicate it, and try to look for any issues to see what happened.

You can use the Compare pages tab in the **Top Pages** report in Site Explorer to get this kind of view for your pages. We will be adding one for the **Organic Keywords** report in the future as well.

![Compare pages view provides a critical view for monitoring your most important pages](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/compare-pages-view-provides-a-critical-view-for-mo.jpg)

#### Crawl comparisons

Select any two crawls for comparison.

For example, you can compare a recent crawl for your website to a crawl back in, say, January. Click on the organic traffic changes column to sort your results and quickly find pages with significant traffic drops during this time.

![Compare any two Site Audit crawls](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png)

Or, go to All issues to track how you’ve been dealing with technical issues on your site since then.

![Compare All Issues in Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image9.png)

#### Track Rankings

Rank Tracker allows for custom segmentation via a flexible tagging system. You can have branded and unbranded, specific product or business unit tags, authors, top 20, or any number of groupings for your own use cases. There are a number of different things you can track, but lots of people typically want to see rankings.

![Ranking terms view in Ahrefs' Rank Tracker](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ranking-terms-view-in-ahrefs-rank-tracker.png)

#### Winners & losers for pages and keywords

You’ll want to check your own pages and keywords to see what’s working well and what’s not. You can do this on the Dashboard or with filters on the individual reports to see more data.

![Winners and loser for your pages, via the Overview report in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/winners-and-loser-for-your-pages-via-the-overview.png)

#### New & lost for pages and keywords

As an enterprise SEO, you can’t be everywhere at once or have visibility on every project happening on the site. You can use the new and lost reports for keywords and pages to help monitor what is changing on the site. Again, this is available on the **Dashboard** or you can filter for them in the individual reports like **Organic Keywords** or **Top Pages.**

![New and lost organic keywords, via the Overview report in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/new-and-lost-organic-keywords-via-the-overview-re.png)

#### Content performance

If you’re running A/B tests, improving a group of pages, or want to monitor different authors or even business units or products who may have multiple sections, you can use the Portfolio feature on the **Dashboard** to add up to 1,000 pages or sections across 10 domains.

![Author portfolio show a rolled up view of various SEO metrics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/author-portfolio-show-a-rolled-up-view-of-various.png)

Many of the reports in Site Explorer will give you rolled up views of the content. Now you can easily see if your tests or improvements had an impact or create a scorecard view for different authors or parts of the business to check how each is doing.

#### Compare SERPs

The SERP comparison feature in Keywords Explorer lets you:

*   See how the SERP for a given keyword has changed over time. Dig into the winners and losers in detail to figure out what Google likes or dislikes. This is especially useful when analyzing Google algorithm updates.

*   Compare the SERPs for two relevant keywords to see how much overlap there is and if you can target both keywords with the same one page, or if you should create a dedicated page for each of the keywords.

![](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image19.png)

#### Hreflang cluster visualization

We have a first-if-its-kind [hreflang](https://ahrefs.com/blog/hreflang-tags/) cluster visualization. It shows and tells you what is broken, making it much easier to explain to stakeholders than the typical spreadsheet.

![The hreflang cluster visualization in Ahrefs' Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-hreflang-cluster-visualization-in-ahrefs-site.png)

### User management

We have everything from single sign-on (SSO), to two-factor authentication (2FA), user controls, audit logs, and more.

#### Also check out our API & Looker Studio reports

In most of our reports, we have an API button that will let you pull the data needed from the reports to re-create the visuals we have or any custom ones you want to create in your own reporting platform. We tried to make this as easy as possible for everyone. You can also check [our API documentation](https://docs.ahrefs.com/docs/api) for any custom data pulls you might want to make.

![Ahrefs API button shows how to pull data from all of the reports](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ahrefs-api-button-shows-how-to-pull-data-from-all.png)

We also have [Looker Studio templates](https://ahrefs.com/google-data-studio-connectors) you can use to create your reports. These are customizable and [well documented](https://docs.ahrefs.com/docs/looker-studio).

![Looker Studio report templates for various SEO data](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/looker-studio-report-templates-for-various-seo-dat.png)

### Final thoughts

Onboarding an enterprise SEO tool can be a long and difficult process. Getting rid of a bad tool once it’s integrated into your systems can be even harder. Make sure you do your homework and select the right solution for you. 

As we’ve built out [our enterprise offering](https://ahrefs.com/enterprise), we’ve added a lot of features that enterprise companies need to be successful and all the pieces they need to meet compliance guidelines. If you have a feature you want to see us add, message me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickstox).
