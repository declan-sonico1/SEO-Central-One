# 8 Pillar Page Examples to Get Inspired By

Pillar pages are high-level introductions to a topic. They then link to other pages, which are usually more detailed guides about parts of the main topic.

Altogether, they form a content hub.

![Example of a content hub](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-content-hub.png)

But not all pillar pages look the same. 

In this guide, we’ll look at eight examples of pillar pages to get your creative juices flowing.

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 1,200  
**Backlinks:** 6,900  
**Referring domains:** 899

This is our very own pillar page, covering the broad topic of [search engine optimization (SEO)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-seo/). 

### Why I like it

Besides the fact that I’m biased, I like the custom design we created for this page, which makes it different from the articles on our blog. 

Even though the design is custom, our pillar page is still a pretty classic “hub and spoke” style pillar page. We’ve broken the topic down neatly into six different chapters and internally linked to guides we’ve created about them. There are also custom animations when you hover over each chapter:

![Examples of chapters in the SEO guide](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20874%20699%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

We’ve also added a glossary section that comes with a custom illustration of the SERPs. We have explanations of what each element means, with internal links to more detailed content:

![Custom illustration of the SERP](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-seo-glossary.png)

Finally, it links to another “pillar page”: our [SEO glossary](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary). 

### Takeaway

Consider creating a custom design for your pillar page so that it stands out.

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 92,200  
**Backlinks:** 21,600  
**Referring domains:** 1,700

![Overview of Diet Doctor's ketogenic diet guide in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7-dietdoctor-pillar-page-stats.png)

Diet Doctor is a health company focusing on low-carb diets. Its pillar page is a comprehensive guide on the keto diet. 

### Why I like it

On the surface, it doesn’t _exactly_ look like a pillar page; it looks like every other post on the Diet Doctor site. But that’s perfectly fine. It’s simply a different approach—you don’t have to call out the fact that it’s a pillar page. 

Diet Doctor’s guide is split into 10 different sections with links to its own resources. The links bring you to different types of content (not just blog posts but videos too).

![Video course about keto diet for beginners](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8-dietdoctor-video-course.jpg)

Unlike the classic pillar page, Diet Doctor’s guide goes into enough detail for anyone who is casually researching the keto diet. But it also links to further resources for anyone who’s interested in doing additional research.

### Takeaway

Pillar pages need not always just be text and links. Make it multimedia: You can add videos and images and even link to your own multimedia resources (e.g., a video course).

![Excerpt of Wine Folly's beginner's guide to wine](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/9-winefolly.png)

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 5,600  
**Backlinks:** 2,800  
**Referring domains:** 247

![Overview of Wine Folly's beginner's guide to wine in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/10-winefolly-stats.png)

Wine Folly is a content site devoted to wine knowledge and appreciation. Its pillar page, as expected, is about wine. 

### Why I like it

Wine Folly’s pillar page is a classic example of a “hub and spoke” style pillar page—split into multiple sections, with some supporting text, and then internal links to other resources that support each subsection. 

![Supporting text and links to other resources](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/11-winefolly-subsection.png)

This page doesn’t just serve as a pillar page for ranking purposes, though. Given that it ranks well and receives quite a significant amount of search traffic, the page also has a call to action (CTA) to Wine Folly’s book:

![Short description of book; below that, CTA encouraging site visitor to purchase it](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/12-winefolly-book.png)

### Takeaway

While most websites design pillar pages for ranking, you can also use them for other purposes: capture email addresses, sell a book, pitch your product, etc.

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 11,100  
**Backlinks:** 3,400  
**Referring domains:** 457

![Overview of Yoga Journal's A-Z directory of yoga poses in Ahrefs' Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/14-yogajournal-stats.png)

Yoga Journal is an online and offline magazine. Its pillar page is an A-Z directory of yoga poses.

### Why I like it

Yoga Journal’s pillar page is straightforward and simple. List down all possible yoga poses (in both their English and Sanskrit names) in a table form and link to them. 

![List of yoga poses in table form
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/15-list-of-yoga-poses.png)

Since it’s listed in alphabetical order, it’s useful for anyone who knows the name of a particular pose and is interested in learning more. 

What I also like is that Yoga Journal has added an extra column on the type of pose each yoga pose belongs to. If we click on any of the pose types, we’re directed to a category page where you can find similar kinds of poses: 

![Examples of standing yoga poses (in grid format)
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/16-yoga-journal-category-page.jpg)

### Takeaway

The A-Z format can be a good format for your pillar page if the broad topic you’re targeting fits the style (e.g., dance moves, freestyle football tricks, etc.).

![Excerpt of Atlassian's guide to agile development

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 115,200  
**Backlinks:** 3,200  
**Referring domains:** 860

![Overview of Atlassian's guide to agile development in Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/18-atlassian-stats.png)

Atlassian is a software company. You’ve probably heard of its products: Jira, Confluence, Trello, etc. Its pillar page is on agile development.

### Why I like it

Atlassian’s pillar page is split into different topics related to agile development. It then has internal links to each topic—both as a sticky table of contents and card-style widgets after the introduction: 

![Sticky table of contents](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/19-agile-table-of-contents.png)

![Card-style widgets
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20-agile-card-widget.jpg)

I also like the “Up next” feature at the bottom of the pillar page, which makes it seem like an online book rather than a page. 

![Example of "Up next" feature
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/21-up-next.png)

### Takeaway

Consider adding a table of contents to your pillar page. 

![Excerpt of Muscle and Strength's workout routines database

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 114,400  
**Backlinks:** 2,900  
**Referring domains:** 592

![Overview of Muscle and Strength's workout routines database in Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/23-muscle-and-strength-stats.png)

Muscle and Strength’s pillar page is a massive database linking to various categories of workouts. 

### Why I like it

Calling it a pillar page seems to be an understatement. Muscle and Strength’s free workouts page appears to be more like a website. 

When you open the page, you’ll see that it’s neatly split into multiple categories, such as “workouts for men,” “workouts for women,” “biceps,” “abs,” etc. 

![Workout categories (in grid format)
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/24-workout-categories.jpg)

Clicking through to any of them leads us to a category page containing all sorts of workouts:

![Types of workouts for men (in grid format)
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/25-category-page.png)

Compared to the other pillar pages on this list, where they’re linking to other subpages, Muscle and Strength’s pillar page links to other category pages, which then link to their subpages, i.e., its massive archive of free workouts.

### Takeaway

Content databases, such as the one above, are a huge undertaking for a pillar page but can be worth it if the broad topic you’re targeting fits a format like this. Ideally, the topic should be about something where the content for it is ever-growing (e.g., workout plans, recipes, email templates, etc.).

![Excerpt of Tofugu's guide to learning Japanese

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 39,100  
**Backlinks:** 1,100  
**Referring domains:** 308

![Overview of Tofugu's guide to learning Japanese in Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/27-learn-japanese-stats.png)

Tofugu is a site about learning Japanese. And its pillar page is about, _well_, learning Japanese.

### Why I like it

This is an incredible (and yes, ridiculously _good_) guide to learning Japanese from scratch. It covers every stage you’ll go through as a complete beginner—from knowing no Japanese to having intermediate proficiency in the language. 

Unlike other pillar pages where information is usually scarce and simply links out to further resources, this page holds nothing back. Under each section, there is great detail about what that section is, why it’s important, how it works, and even an estimated time of how long that stage takes to complete. 

Another interesting aspect is how Tofugu has structured its internal links as active CTAs. Rather than “Learn more” or “Read more,” it’s all about encouraging users to do a task and completing that stage. 

![CTA encouraging user to head to the next task of learning to read hiragana
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/28-cta.png)

### Takeaway

Two takeaways here:

*   Pillar pages can be ridiculously comprehensive. It depends on the topic you’re targeting and how competitive it is.
*   CTAs can be more exciting than merely just “Read more.”

### Key stats

**Estimated organic traffic:** 890  
**Backlinks:** 4,100  
**Referring domains:** 1,100

![Overview of Zapier's guide to working remotely in Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/30-zapier-stats.png)

Zapier allows users to connect multiple software products together via “zaps.” It’s a 100% remote company, and its pillar page is about remote work. 

### Why I like it

Zapier’s pillar page is basically like Wine Folly’s pillar page. Break a topic into subsections, add a couple of links of text, and then add internal links to further resources. 

In the examples above, we’ve seen all sorts of execution for pillar pages. There are those with custom designs and others that are crazily comprehensive.

But sometimes, all a pillar page needs is a simple design with links. 

### Takeaway

If you already have a bunch of existing content on your website, you can create a simple pillar page like this to organize your content for your readers.
