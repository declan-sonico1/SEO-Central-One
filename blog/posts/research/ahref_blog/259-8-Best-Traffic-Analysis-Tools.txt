# 8 Best Traffic Analysis Tools

Monitoring your website traffic is one of the best ways to make data-driven decisions on how effectively your marketing campaigns and messaging work.

Moreover, checking out your competitors’ website traffic can help you identify areas for improvement on your own site. 

In this article, we will look at the top eight traffic analysis tools, what we like about them, and some tips on how to get the most out of each tool. 

You need different tools depending on whether you want insights into your own traffic or someone else’s. If it’s the latter, head to the sixth tool on the list (using our sidebar). 

Probably the most used and best-known traffic analysis tool available, Google Analytics is a tool that probably every website owner should be using.

It can track acquisition reports to find out how users get to the site, audience reports to better tailor experiences to different groups, and conversion reports to keep an eye on goals or events.

![Google Analytics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image6.jpg)

It also offers real-time tracking so viewers can see how many active users there are.

### Benefits

Some of the top things we like about Google Analytics include:

*   Managing more than one property under a single account.
*   Extensive reporting on traffic, engagement, and conversions.
*   Allowing for audience segmentation for Google Ads remarketing campaigns.

### How to use it

*   First, sign up for a [Google Analytics account](https://developers.google.com/analytics) (if you don’t have one).
*   You need to add the tracking code for Google Analytics to your website. This code will collect data about the individuals visiting your website and then send it to the account you have set up for Google Analytics.
*   Google Analytics will begin collecting data about your website as soon as the tracking code is installed and activated on the site.

One of the most useful (but often underutilized) detailed reports in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the Path Exploration Overview.

Go to _Explore > Path Exploration._

This is a custom report (you’ll need to set it to use it in a way that works best for you), but it can be extremely useful!

The report allows you to see the specific path users take to get to specified URLs on your website. Or what’s often more helpful—review a reverse path, i.e., see how users got to a specific conversion point, for example. 

![GA4 Path Exploration example](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image11.jpg)

### Pricing

Google Analytics is 100% free. Yet, its features still manage to rival a number of premium tools. 

One of the most widely used and essential traffic analysis tools is Google Search Console. It is a free service provided by Google that allows website owners to monitor and optimize their sites’ visibility in search engine results.

![Checking performance of web search clicks on Google Search Console](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image12.jpg)

It lets you see the number of clicks, impressions, average position, and click-through rate (CTR) for each page on your website.

### Benefits

*   Provides detailed data on organic clicks, impressions, and click-through rate (CTR)
*   Allows you to identify and fix technical issues that could be affecting your website’s performance in the SERPs
*   Shows the keywords that are driving traffic to your website with their search volume and positions

### How to use it

*   First, sign in to [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) with your Google account.
*   You should see a “welcome” message with two options. Select the first one, then enter your domain or subdomain (without the `http(s)://`).
*   Lastly, verify your domain, and Search Console will start gathering data.

One of the best things about Google Search Console (in terms of analyzing traffic) is that you can see which of your pages are losing traffic. That means you know which pages are a priority when it comes to updating and optimizing your content.

You can do this by going to the **Performance** report, then adding a date range comparison to see stats for the past six months compared to the previous six months. Turn off “Impressions,” as you only need to focus on clicks; then click on “Pages.”

Sort the report by “Clicks Difference” in ascending order to see the pages with the biggest traffic drops.

![Sorting pages by clicks difference in GSC](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image9.jpg)

### Pricing

Google Search Console is also completely free. 

Ahrefs Webmaster Tools is a powerful, free SEO tool that analyzes traffic and monitors the SEO health of your website.

![Ahrefs Webmaster Tools](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image7.jpg)

The best thing about Ahrefs Webmaster Tools is that it shows you all of the keywords you rank for rather than just the top 1,000 like Google Search Console.

It also gives you more data that you can use to find ways to [increase your traffic](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-increase-organic-traffic/). By identifying high-volume keywords where you already rank in positions #4–#10, you can focus your efforts on improving their rankings.

![Keyword positions example](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image4.jpg)

Plus, you can find keywords with featured snippets where you rank in the top five but not in the snippet; then, optimize for them accordingly.

Similarweb is a platform that tracks your market share, benchmarks, trends, and traffic analysis. 

It’s a popular choice for a quick traffic spot check, but it also offers premium features and data. 

![Similarweb](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image1.jpg)

### Benefits

*   Offers free traffic lookup across different channels with additional data points (such as audience insight)
*   Allows you to compare two websites across channels 
*   Has many more features in premium plans 

### How to use it

*   Sign up to [Similarweb’s free trial](https://account.similarweb.com/journey/registration?_gl=1*1kmhipd*_ga*MzMwNjQwNjAwLjE2OTI4MDMxMjE.*_ga_5M34ZH84YZ*MTY5MjgwMzEyMS4xLjEuMTY5MjgwNDc0MS4wLjAuMA..) for full use of the tool
*   Use its [free website analysis tool](https://www.similarweb.com/)

Here’s the thing about Similarweb:

In reality, there is probably no better tool for getting detailed traffic analytics data across different channels for a site you don’t own. 

Unlike other tools that can give you an overall traffic number, Similarweb will give you details such as bounce rate, pages per visit, etc. 

This is great for detailed comparisons between your own site and a competitor. It also comes in useful when checking out a site you are considering buying. 

But you should take the metrics provided with a pinch of salt. From experience, Similarweb’s traffic numbers are pretty all over the place. 

For example, here are Similarweb’s traffic metrics for a new testing site I have:

![Similarweb's metrics for a website](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image8.jpg)

Now here are the same metrics in GA4:

![GSC's metrics for a website](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image14.jpg)

As you can see, the numbers in Similarweb are significantly overestimated. Therefore, keep this in mind, especially if you are using it to check out how traffic is trending for a site you want to buy.

### Pricing

Similarweb is the most expensive tool, starting from $125 per user, per month with limited tracking and historical data. 

You can, however, use its free website analysis tool to check out limited traffic data about any website.

## FAQs

Frequently asked questions about traffic analysis tools. 

### How do traffic analysis tools work?

Website traffic analysis tools give detailed information about the people who visit your website.

The main metrics monitored by these tools include:

*   **Visits and sessions** – How many times your website was visited during a specific time frame (for example, the previous 30 days).
*   **Traffic sources** – How someone arrived on your site. This can be direct (typed your URL), organic (from search engines), social (clicked a link on a social media platform), and referral (clicked a link to your site on another site).
*   **Page views** – How many times visitors viewed a page on your website.
*   **Unique visits** – The number of individuals who visited your website. For example, you may have 1,000 visits, but only 100 may be unique. If the same person visits your website multiple times, they count as one unique visit.
*   **Bounce rate** – The percentage of people who left your site after visiting only one page.
*   **Conversion rate** – The percentage of people who completed a set action, such as made a purchase or booked a call.
*   **Average time on page** – How long users spend on a specific page on average.
*   **Demographics** – Details about the people who visited your website. For example, age, gender, their interests, etc.
*   **Device and location data** – This lets you know which devices people have accessed your website from (desktop/mobile) and the geographical areas they visited from.

### Why use traffic analysis tools?

With data from traffic analysis tools, you can figure out what is working and what needs work.

One key benefit is understanding a website’s most popular content, pages, or entry points. These insights can help publishers prioritize creating content that gets more attention from readers.

### Why should you check your competitors’ website traffic?

You can use your competitors’ traffic to benchmark your own performance and uncover opportunities for growth and expansion.

For example, if you find that they are receiving a significant amount of traffic from a specific source or targeting specific keywords, you can consider doing the same.
