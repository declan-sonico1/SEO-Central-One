# 25 Types of Content You Can Use for Content Marketing

What type of content should you create for your content marketing?

From blog posts to memes, learn the 25 different types of content you can use for your content marketing strategy.

## 1\. Blog posts

Blog posts are a great way to educate your audience and “sell” what you do in the process.

### Example

Our [list of free keyword research tools](https://ahrefs.com/blog/free-keyword-research-tools/) features four of our own tools.

![Ahrefs' post on free keyword research tools
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image15-3.png)

### How to market them

If you want consistent traffic to your blog posts, write about topics people search for on Google and [use SEO to rank high](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-rank-higher-on-google/).

How can you find these topics?

Look at which of your competitors’ posts get the most organic search traffic.

Here’s how:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer)
2.  Enter a popular industry blog
3.  Go to the **Top pages** report
4.  Toggle **SERP titles** on 

![Top pages report, via Ahrefs' Site Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image13-3.png)

## 2\. Videos

Videos are a great way to reach a wide audience and show your product or service in action.

### Example

Our video on lesser-known link building tactics shows how you can execute them with the help of our toolset.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5jmQig8FJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5jmQig8FJU)

### How to market them

If you’re starting out with no audience, the best way to generate traffic to your videos is to rank high on YouTube. You can do this by targeting topics people are searching for on YouTube.

Here’s how to find these topics:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Switch the tab to **YouTube**
3.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
4.  Go to the **Matching terms** report

![Finding "YouTube" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19-3.png)

## 3\. Podcasts

Podcasts are a great way to build brand awareness, reach a wide audience, and network with industry experts.

### Example

In only six months, HubSpot’s “Marketing Against the Grain” podcast hit [70,000 monthly downloads](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kieranjflanagan_we-grew-marketing-against-the-grain-to-activity-6981237691187134464-5pi5/?originalSubdomain=sn)—many of whom are marketers and potential customers.

### How to market them

A few ideas to get the word out for your podcast:

*   Record your podcast as a video so it can be uploaded on YouTube (instead of just having it in audio)
*   Share snippets of your podcast on social media ([here’s an example](https://twitter.com/ramit/status/1643327598389346313))
*   Be a guest on other podcasts
*   Transcribe your podcast and [send highlights to journalists](https://tim.blog/2016/04/11/tim-ferriss-podcast-business/) 

## 4\. How-tos

How-tos are a great way to teach your audience to solve problems step by step with your product or service.

### Example

Our [article on keyword optimization](https://ahrefs.com/blog/keyword-optimization/) shows how to complete the process with our toolset.

![Ahrefs' blog post on keyword optimization
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image21-2.jpg)

### How to market them

The best way is to rank your how-tos on Google and generate consistent search traffic. To do this, target “how to” keywords.

Here’s how to find them:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “how”

![Finding "how to" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image10-4.png)

## 5\. Guides

Guides are a great way to introduce your audience to a specific topic and insert your product or service in the process.

### Example

Our [beginner’s guide to technical SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/technical-seo/) explains everything you need to know about technical SEO, including how to use our toolset to fix technical issues.

![Ahrefs' guide to technical SEO
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image31-1.jpg)

### How to market them

The best way is to rank your guides high on Google. Here’s how to find guide-related topics:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “what”

![Finding "guide" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image14-3.png)

Sidenote.

Not all of this will be guide-related keywords (e.g., “what does seo stand for”), so make sure you analyze the SERPs first.

## 6\. Newsletters

Newsletters are a great way to build an audience whom you can reach out to any time. They’re also great for [distributing content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/content-distribution/).

### Example

We send a [weekly newsletter](https://ahrefs.com/newsletter) to 200,000 people that features content from our blog and elsewhere.

![Example of an Ahrefs' Digest issue
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image3-4.png)

### How to market them

The best way is to encourage people to opt in for the newsletter when they’re already consuming your content. You can do this via a simple opt-in (like us) or with an incentive (via the other content formats in this post).

![Ahrefs' subscribe box
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image4-4.png)

## 7\. Listicles

Don’t just riff off a list of items; expand your listicles with specific steps. This will allow you to “sell” your product or service naturally.

### Example

Our [listicle on driving traffic to your website](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/) shows how you can use our toolset in different tactics.

![Ahrefs' blog post on driving traffic to your website
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image28-1-1.jpg)

### How to market them

Like other blog post formats, the best way is to rank your listicle high on Google. Here’s how to find potential list-based topics:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add list-based keywords like “ideas, tips, tools, things, strategies, tactics, list”

![Finding "listicle" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image5-4.png)

## 8\. Ebooks

Usually <100 pages, ebooks work as great incentives to encourage visitors to opt in to your email list.

### Example

To get a free copy of Intercom’s [book on marketing](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/intercom-marketing), it requires prospects to fill in relevant details (e.g., name, email address, and more).

![Intercom's opt-in box for its book
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image7-4.png)

### How to market them

Create a dedicated landing page for your ebook that’s designed to capture email addresses. You can then link to this landing page from your blog posts or run ads to it.

## 9\. Physical books

Physical books are generally regarded as high-value and signal that the brand is serious about content and education.

### Example

The [launch of our new SEO book for beginners](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-for-beginners-book/) generated a positive reception.

### How to market them

The best way to market a book is [word of mouth](https://ahrefs.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/). To get the flywheel going, run a giveaway of your book.

## 10\. Checklists

Checklists are a great way to drive tons of search traffic and insert your product or service as part of the checklist. They can also work well as a content upgrade.

### Example

Our [SEO checklist](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-checklist/) ranks in position #2 and generates a lot of search traffic.

![Ahrefs' SEO checklist post ranks in position #2, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image16-2.png)

### How to market them

The best way is to rank your checklist high on Google. Here’s how to find potential checklist topics:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “checklist”

![Finding "checklist" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image22-2.png)

## 11\. Templates

Like checklists, templates are a good way to “insert” your product or service into the process. They also work well as [lead magnets](https://ahrefs.com/blog/lead-magnet/).

### Example

Our [guide to keyword strategy](https://ahrefs.com/blog/keyword-strategy/) offers a free template for anyone to copy.

![Ahrefs' guide to keyword strategy
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image1-6.png)

### How to market them

Don’t create templates no one wants. Make sure people are looking for it. You can do this by looking for templates people are searching for.

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “template”

![Finding "template" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image11-3.png)

## 12\. White papers

Since the goal of a white paper is to show necessary data and facts to explain why a product is the best on the market, it can work as a lead magnet for prospects who are interested in learning more about your product.

### Example

Ultimaker, a 3D printer manufacturer, gathers contact information from an audience interested in the real cost of owning a 3D printer.

![3D printing white paper from Ultimaker
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image12-2.png)

### How to market them

Create a dedicated landing page for your white paper. You can then link to this landing page from your blog posts or run ads to it.

## 13\. Social media posts

Social media posts are great for increasing brand awareness, reaching a broader audience, and building a following interested in your brand, content, product, or service.

### Example

Ahrefs posts regularly on Twitter, including threads.

> Find low-competition keywords in 3 steps 
> 
> Building a new website and looking to strengthen your link profile? Capture low-hanging keywords.
> 
> You can find them using an SEO tool featuring a difficulty score—like Ahrefs’ Keyword Difficulty.

### How to market them

Each social media platform has its own rules, culture, and media type (e.g., short-form videos on TikTok, carousels on LinkedIn, long-form on Twitter). Learn what they are and create content that matches what people on the platform want to see.

## 14\. Illustrations and infographics

Illustrations and infographics are great ways to condense text, concepts, and ideas into a shareable form. They also work great on social media.

### Example

Our [post on how to get on the first page of Google](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-get-on-the-first-page-of-google/) features a flowchart.

![Flowchart on how to get on the first page of Google
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23-2.jpg)

### How to market them

Create illustrations and infographics that people want to see. You can do this by following the TRUST formula:

1.  Find a **T**rending topic
2.  Do **R**esearch and analysis to find interesting data
3.  Present a **U**nique takeaway 
4.  Create a **S**imple visual
5.  Promote **T**actically

## 15\. Tools

Free tools are a great way to let customers test-drive your product or service.

### Example

Our [backlink checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker) is one of the many [free SEO tools](https://ahrefs.com/free-seo-tools) we offer.

![Ahrefs' free backlink checker
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image17-2.png)

### How to market them

Don’t guess what tools people want. Create them based on what people are searching for:

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “tool, tools, checker, calculator”

![Finding "tool" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image18-4.png)

## 16\. Courses

Courses are a great way to educate your audience, especially about how to use your product or use your product to solve their problems.

### Example

Our [SEO course for beginners](https://ahrefs.com/academy/seo-training-course) teaches the basics of SEO using Ahrefs.

![Ahrefs' SEO course for beginners

1.  Go to Ahrefs’ [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
2.  Enter one or a few relevant keywords
3.  Go to the **Matching terms** report
4.  In the **Include** filter, add “course”

![Finding "course" keywords, via Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image26-2.png)

## 17\. Case studies

Case studies can be an effective nudge for turning a prospect into a customer.

### Example

Recruiting software Lever has [hundreds of case studies](https://www.lever.co/customers/) based on customer size and industry.

![Lever's customer case studies
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image2-6.png)

### How to market them

The best way is to add them to your website so visitors can navigate there.

![Lever's navigation to its case studies
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image8-4.png)

They can also be used as part of your sales process.

## 18\. Testimonials

Testimonials are a great way to add social proof to your website.

### Example

We have a rolling carousel of testimonials on our homepage, separated by our customer profiles.

![Testimonials from happy Ahrefs customers
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image20-3.png)

### How to market them

The best way is to put them on your homepage.

## 19\. Webinars

Webinars are a great way to generate leads or onboard customers.

### Example

We mainly use [webinars](https://community.ahrefs.com/c/events/) as onboarding at Ahrefs.

![The email that Ahrefs sends to invite people to the onboarding webinar
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image29-1.png)

### How to market them

The specific promotion strategy will depend on your goals for webinars:

*   If you’re using them as onboarding for new or existing customers, you can promote them via your email list.
*   If you’re using them for [lead generation](https://ahrefs.com/blog/lead-generation/), consider partnering with experts and influencers in your niche so they can promote them to various audiences.

## 20\. Quizzes

Quizzes are a great way to [acquire links](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building/), build brand awareness, and segment your audience.

### Example

Todoist runs a [quiz on the best productivity methods](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods).

![Todoist's productivity methods quiz
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image9-3.png)

### How to market them

Add them to your website so visitors can navigate and find them.

![Todoist's navigation to its productivity methods quiz
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image24-2.jpg)

## 21\. Interactive content

Interactive forms of content, like games, allow prospects and customers to play with content. They’re a great [type of content to attract backlinks](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-bait/).

### Example

Swedish financial company Advisa created a [game](https://advisa.se/en/research/brexit-bus/) to indirectly comment on the British pound after Brexit was confirmed.

![Brexit bus game
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image25-2.png)

### How to market them

The best way is to pitch your interactive content to relevant news websites. 

## 22\. Interviews

Interviews are a great way to create expert content and tap into other people’s audiences. They can be in any format: video, audio, or text.

### Example

Our chief marketing officer, [Tim Soulo](https://twitter.com/timsoulo?lang=en), interviews expert SEOs and marketers for our [customers-only community](https://community.ahrefs.com/):

![Ahrefs' interview series, "This Never Happened"
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image6-4.jpg)

### How to market them

Promote your interview via your email list. You should also encourage your guest to promote the interview to their audience.

## 23\. Slide decks

Slide decks are usually created for conferences and work well as thought leadership. 

### Example

This is a presentation from Tim at BrightonSEO, an SEO conference.

### How to market them

After your presentation, upload your slide decks on SlideShare.

## 24\. Memes

Primarily for social media, memes are a great way to engage with your audience.

### Example

Fast-food restaurant Wendy’s is well known for posting memes on Twitter.

### How to market them

Since memes are mainly for engaging with your audience, the best way is to post them on the social media platform you’re using to engage with said audience.

## 25\. User-generated content

User-generated content (UGC) is a great way to build and engage with your audience.

### Example

Every post and reply in our customers-only community is UGC and contributes to its engagement and activity.

![Posts and comments from members in Ahrefs' community
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image27-2.png)

### How to market them

Rather than market UGC, a better way would be to figure out how to generate more of it. For example, we’d want more activity in our community (and therefore more UGC).

While there’s no surefire way to do this, one thing’s certain—you have to be a brand that your customers love. That means creating an amazing product and providing great customer service.

Beyond that, you’ll also want to make things exclusive so your customers feel like they’re part of an invite-only community. For example:

*   Our interview series, “This Never Happened,” is live, and the recording is only available to our community for 24 hours.
*   Adidas Yeezys are limited edition, and you can’t get them anywhere else.
*   To launch his chocolate brand, Feastables, MrBeast [embedded 10 golden tickets](https://tclarkmedia.substack.com/p/-how-mrbeast-launched-feastables) that represent the opportunity to be featured in a MrBeast video, remaking Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory in real life.
