Free SEO tools may be limited, but you can still use them to do SEO. You just need the right ones to cover your use cases.

Add these 34 free SEO tools to your SEO toolkit.

**_Monitor your website’s SEO health, see who’s linking to you, and learn what your website is ranking for on Google._**

**_Find keyword ideas from Google’s keyword research tool._**

![Google Analytics' keyword ideas report](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/google-analytics-keyword-ideas-report.png)

Google Keyword Planner (GKP) is Google’s keyword research tool for [Google Ads](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ppc-marketing/). But you can use it for SEO, too. It’s especially useful for finding trending or seasonal keywords.

Sidenote.

One limitation of GKP is that it doesn’t show absolute search volumes, only a range.

### Highlighted feature

Most keyword research tools show you ideas based on your seed keyword. For example, if you enter “coffee,” you’ll get ideas like “coffee bean,” “keurig coffee maker,” and “coffee shops.”

GKP can show you relevant keywords based on semantics. For example, GKP suggests keywords like “nespresso pods,” “espresso,” “french press,” and “breville barista express” even though they don’t contain the word “coffee.”

![Relevant keywords about coffee that do not contain the seed keyword "coffee"](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/relevant-keywords-about-coffee-that-do-not-contain.png)

### Highlighted feature
