# How long does it take to rank in Google? (A study by Ahrefs)

If you’re doing client SEO, I guess every new client, without any exceptions, will ask you this question: 

> “How long till my website (page) ranks [on top of Google](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-get-on-top-of-google-search/)?”

The common response to this question is obviously, “It depends,” because there are just too many variables to consider: website strength, competition, budget, skills, etc.

But here at Ahrefs, we decided to sift through the petabytes of historical ranking data that we have and give you a slightly more quantifiable answer, something more concrete than simply, “It depends.”

## How old are the top-ranking pages?

For starters, we identified how old the current top-ranking pages are.

We took 2 million random keywords and pulled data on the Top10 ranking pages for each of them. Which resulted in this beautiful graph:

Sidenote.

The “age” is calculated from the date when Ahrefs crawlers first saw the page. But since we crawl the web at a pretty [staggering speed](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ahrefs-seo-metrics/), the actual age of the page should be very close, if not identical, to our records. 

As you can tell from this graph, the average Top10 ranking page is 2+ years old. And those that rank at position #1 are almost 3 years old (on average).

In fact, only 22% of pages that currently rank in the Top10 were created within 1 year:

So the next thing we wanted to know is what percentage of pages at each ranking position were less than 1 year old:

This doesn’t look too promising, right? The [SERP](https://ahrefs.com/blog/serps/) is clearly dominated by “old” pages.

To answer this question, we randomly selected 2 million pages that were first seen by Ahrefs crawler a year ago.

We then tracked the position history of each page for any keyword it’s ranked for.

Which resulted in this graph:

![](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/04-ranking-performance-by-DR-2.png)

Only 5.7% of all studied pages ranked in the Top10 search results within 1 year for at least 1 keyword.

Pages from websites with a high Domain Rating (DR) performed way better than those with a low DR. Which shouldn’t come as a surprise, because [Ahrefs’ Domain Rating metric](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ahrefs-seo-metrics/) (shows the strength of a website’s backlink profile) [correlates well with Google rankings](https://ahrefs.com/blog/on-page-seo/).

We then zoomed into these 5.7% of “lucky” pages to see how quickly they got from nowhere to the Top10.

The majority of them managed to achieve that in approximately 61-182 days.

By looking at this graph, you might think that, on average, it takes a page anywhere from 2-6 months to rank in Google’s Top10.

But that conclusion isn’t valid here, because this data only represents the 5.7% of pages that were lucky enough to rank in the Top10 within a year — while almost 95% of all the pages we studied didn’t make it to the Top10 within that timeframe.

We also re-calculated the numbers based on monthly search volume of the keywords:

![](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/06-ranking-performance-by-Volume-2.png)

Only 0.3% of pages ranked in the Top10 for a high-volume keyword in less than a year.

And here are the dynamics of these 5.7% “lucky” pages, broken down by search volume of the keyword that they ranked for:

![](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/07-lucky-pages-by-Volume-1.png)

Clearly, you can rank for [low-volume keywords](https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/) in a very short time, while the high-volume ones take almost a year to get into the Top10.

But again, don’t forget that this data only applies to 5.7% of “lucky” pages that ranked in the Top10 within a year. The vast majority of pages don’t perform that well.

## What does this all mean?

Did our study give a definite answer to “how long does it take to rank” question?

No.

But at least we’ve shown that almost 95% of newly published pages don’t get to the Top10 within a year.

And most of the “lucky” ones, which do manage to get there, do it in about 2-6 months.

Actually, I shouldn’t be framing these pages as “lucky,” because the reason they got to the Top10 in less than a year is most likely hard work and great knowledge of [SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-seo/), not luck.
