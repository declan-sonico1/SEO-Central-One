# We Published a Children’s Book. Here's How to Get It.

The SEO industry is over 20 years old at this point. And it comes as no surprise that many of us are parents to little kids. I myself am a father of two.

So we figured it would be cool to create a children’s book that both kids and their SEO parents could enjoy together.

## Introducing: “White Haired SEO (Super Exciting Odyssey)”

This book tells the story of Jessy: a curious little girl, who touched her mother’s computer and got teleported to the magical world of her work. There she took on an exciting adventure—she had to deliver a very important book to the top of Mount Fjoogle ().

Did she succeed? What challenges did she have to overcome? You’ll have to read the book to find out!

This book is not meant to teach your kids SEO. It’s just a typical bedtime story for them. But for us parents, it has a bunch of references and easter eggs from the world of SEO.

The book also gives your children a rough idea of what their mommy or daddy does at work. It’s hard to explain SEO, but taking an important book to the world’s most important library seems like something a 4-year-old can understand.

We really wanted your kids to love this book, so our illustrator, [Alyona Malashenko](https://www.instagram.com/alenka.illustration/), spent a lot of time filling each page with beautiful illustrations. We didn’t compromise on the print quality either; it’s a hardcover with vibrant, colorful pages.

I assembled an expert “focus group” to test this book and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive .

We printed 2000 copies and we plan to give them all out for free to our customers and fans. 

There are three ways you can get a copy:

### 1\. Find the Ahrefs booth at an SEO conference

We’ll make sure to take at least a hundred copies with us to the conferences we sponsor and give them out at our booth.

Our next three confirmed conferences are:

*   [Digital Marketing Conference DMWF Global](https://www.digitalmarketing-conference.com/asia/)[,](https://www.digitalmarketing-conference.com/asia/) 28–29 February 2024 (Singapore)
*   [Sydney SEO Conference](https://prosperitymedia.com.au/sydney-seo-conference/), 1 March 2024 (Sydney, Australia)
*   [brightonSEO](https://brightonseo.com/), 25–26 April 2024 (Brighton, UK)

### 2\. Look out for giveaways

We already did one giveaway of this book [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ahrefs/status/1734839928201322588) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140610994963177472/) before Christmas, but we plan to do more. So please follow Ahrefs (as well as [myself](https://twitter.com/timsoulo)) on socials, so that you don’t miss it.

### 3\. Ask our support team nicely

In case you didn’t win in a giveaway and don’t plan to attend any SEO conferences, but you really really want a copy—you can try your luck with our support team.

If you’ve been our customer for a couple years and you have kids aged 3-7, there’s a very good chance that we’ll send you a copy. But that would be subject to availability. If too many people ask for it, we’ll unfortunately need to say no to some of them.

(And before you ask—no, we won’t be selling any copies of the book.)
