# SEO Salary Survey 2023 \[Industry Research\]

How much do SEOs earn? I wanted to know, so I ran a survey at [Brighton SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/brighton-seo/) and asked 111 attendees what they earned.

Editor’s note

We realize that this is a small sample set and not representative of all SEO salaries as it’s focused on UK and EU data. If you want to be part of the next Ahrefs salary survey, [you can submit your details anonymously here](https://s.surveyplanet.com/ht4xebbj).

**Here are the top takeaways:**

*   The median annual salary for SEOs we polled was $49,211
*   The highest annual salary we polled was $229,652
*   To earn the higher salaries in SEO you need be a [technical SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/technical-seo/) expert—Heads of SEO, SEO Directors and SEO Leads all said that their main specialization was technical SEO 
*   Only 5.4% of respondents learned SEO through a course—most learned on the job (52.3%) or by themselves (42.3%)
*   36.9% described themselves as content specialists, 30.6% described themselves as technical specialists, 6.3% described themselves as specializing in [link-building](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building/)
*   49.5% of respondents worked in [SEO agencies](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-does-an-seo-agency-do/), 42.3% in-house and 8.2% were self-employed
*   Most respondents (28.8%) worked in companies that had 11-50 people
*   The average [SEO experience](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-experience/) of our respondents was 6.9 years
*   [Self-employed](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-freelancer/) SEOs earned the most on average ($60,232k)—the median annual salary for in-house roles was slightly lower at $56,789, and agency SEOs had the lowest median annual salary at $44,169

**There were also a few surprises:**

*   Few SEOs in our survey said that they specialized in link building compared to technical and content. This is despite the fact that links are still one of the most important [Google ranking factors](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-ranking-factors/).
*   The average level of experience between SEO Directors and Head of SEO is not that different—10.4 years for a SEO Director and 10.6 years for a Head of SEO—but the salary difference between the roles was ~$11,552—quite substantial.

Here’s how annual salaries broke down across our respondents:

![Chart listing average salaries of SEO professionals.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-what-is-your-annual-salary.png)

## How did they learn SEO?

According to the SEOs we polled, most of them learned SEO on the job or were self-taught. 

![Chart displaying how individuals learned SEO.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-6.png)

## Average level of experience by role

Most of our respondents had a couple of years of experience under their belts. The amount of experience Head of SEOs had versus SEO Directors was not that different, at around 10 years.

![Average level of experience by role](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image1-8.png)

*   Across **all respondents**, the average experience was 6.9 years
*   For **Head of SEO**, the average experience was 10.6 years
*   For **SEO Director**, the average experience was 10.4 years
*   For **SEO Lead**, the average experience was 7.4 years
*   For **SEO Account Manager**, the average experience was 4.2 years
*   For **SEO Consultant**, the average experience was 6 years 
*   For **SEO Executive**, the average experience was 3 years 
*   For **SEO Analyst**, the average experience was 5 years

## What areas of SEO do they specialize in? 

Technical and Content were the two top skills that SEOs we surveyed specialized in.

![Areas of SEO specialization](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image5-6.png)

The proportion of SEOs that said they specialized in links was much lower despite links being a major ranking factor.

## Where are they based?

Our survey showed an almost 50/50 split between the UK and Europe. 48.6% of respondents were from the UK—perhaps not surprising given that BrightonSEO is based in the UK.

![Chart of countries SEOs are from](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image11-5.png)

## Where do they work?

Most of the respondents we spoke to worked in agencies or in-house. It does mean, however, that our salary data was mainly focused on these two employment types.

![Chart listing where SEOs work](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image14-5.png)

## How big are the companies they work in?

Across all respondents, the most common company size was 11-50. A large proportion of SEOs also worked for substantially larger companies that had over 1000 employees.

## How much does each SEO role earn?

Here’s the full breakdown of each role.

### Head of SEO salary

It’s probably not too much of a surprise that the Head of SEO role was our highest-paying SEO role surveyed. What’s more of a surprise was the variation in salary—our survey showed that a Head of SEO can earn anything from ~$25k to ~$229k. 

![head-of-seo-salary](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/head-of-seo-salary.png)

#### Average experience

According to our survey, a Head of SEO has ~10.6 years of experience.

#### Type of company

46.7% of respondents worked for an agency, and 46.7% worked in-house. 6.7% were self-employed.

#### Education

66.7% of respondents said they were self-taught, 26.7% said they’d learned on the job, and 6.7% said that they had learned SEO from a course.

#### Specialization

40% said that they specialized in technical SEO, 33.3% in Content, and 13.3% said they were a generalist. The remaining 13.4% said they focused on people management. 

This is surprising, as it implies that 73.3% of people in Head of SEO roles are actively providing SEO services for their clients rather than focusing on managing a team.

#### Company size

There were two company sizes that were most popular for Head of SEOs to work in. 40% of respondents said they worked in companies with 11-50 people, and 20% said they worked in companies with over 1001 people. 

#### Location

40% of respondents were from the UK, 13.3% were from the Netherlands, and the remainder were from mainland Europe.

### SEO Director salary

The salary variation wasn’t quite as extreme for SEO Directors, but salaries ranged from ~$42k to ~$121k—still quite a difference.

![SEO Director salary](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-seo-director-salary.png)

#### Average experience

SEO Directors in our survey had 10.4 years of experience on average.

#### Type of company

There was a 50/50 split between SEO Directors’ backgrounds, with 50% from agency and 50% from in-house

#### Company size

According to our survey, SEO Directors typically work in medium to large companies. 25% said that they worked in companies that had over 1000 people, and 25% said they worked in companies that had 51-100 employees.

#### Location

Most SEO Directors we surveyed were from the UK (62.5%). The rest were equal splits between India, the U.S., and Germany (12.5%).

### SEO Lead salary

SEO Leads typically have a lot of experience, but our survey shows that they only earn slightly more on average than SEO Specialists.

![SEO Lead salary

#### Average experience

### SEO Specialist salary

SEO Specialists we surveyed had around 5-6 years of experience, but they typically got paid better than SEO Leads. Based on my experience, this may be due to in-house roles paying better than agency roles in the UK.

![SEO Specialist salary](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5-seo-specialist-salary.png)

SEO Specialists in our survey had an average of 5.8 years of experience.

#### Location

85.7% of respondents were from the UK, and 14.3% of the remainder were from Europe.

### SEO Consultant salary

SEO Consultants we surveyed earned up to ~$87k, which was lower than I was expecting—because our [SEO pricing](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-pricing/) post suggested that SEO consultants charge between $100-150 per hour. 

But as the data is UK-focused, the likely reason for this is the [£85k VAT tax threshold](https://www.taxpolicy.org.uk/2023/01/30/vat_brake2/). 

![SEO Consultant salary](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7-seo-consultant-salary.png)

Sidenote.

## Final thoughts

SEO salaries aren’t often discussed in detail within the industry, so getting a snapshot of their current state from one of the biggest [SEO conferences](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-conferences-roundup/) in the UK was insightful.

For our next salary survey, we’ll be opening it up to all SEOs. If you’d like to take part—you can [enter here](https://s.surveyplanet.com/ht4xebbj).
