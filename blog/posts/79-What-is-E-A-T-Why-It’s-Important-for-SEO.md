# E-A-T in SEO: What It Is and Why It Matters

Since August 2018, E-A-T has been a hot topic in the SEO world, appearing in countless articles and discussions. Some claim it's a crucial ranking factor, while others argue it isn't. This discrepancy has led to confusion among SEO professionals and website owners alike. So what's the truth? Let's dive into the world of E-A-T and uncover its importance in SEO.

## What is E-A-T?

E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It originates from Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines, a comprehensive 168-page document used by human quality raters to assess search result quality. Google made this document public in 2013 to help webmasters understand what they look for in web pages.

The concept of E-A-T is not new, but its prominence in SEO discussions has increased significantly in recent years. This surge in interest is largely due to Google's increasing emphasis on content quality and user experience.

## How Important is E-A-T?

While E-A-T matters for all queries, its importance varies depending on the nature of the content and the potential impact on users' lives. For lighthearted searches like "cute cat pictures," E-A-T isn't critical. The topic is subjective, and there's little risk associated with viewing images that don't perfectly match your idea of cuteness.

However, for queries related to Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics, E-A-T becomes crucial. YMYL topics include areas such as health, finance, safety, and any other subject that could significantly impact a person's future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.

For instance, if you're searching for "aspirin dosage during pregnancy," the expertise and trustworthiness of the content are vital. Inaccurate information in this context could potentially harm both the mother and the unborn child. Similarly, for topics like "how to improve credit score," advice from unreliable sources could lead to serious financial issues.

Google takes these YMYL topics very seriously. They understand that providing low-quality or inaccurate information on these subjects could have real-world consequences for users. As such, pages covering YMYL topics are held to higher E-A-T standards.

## How is E-A-T Evaluated?

Google evaluates Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness separately, recognizing that while these concepts are related, they are not identical. Let's break down how each component is assessed:

### Expertise

Expertise is primarily evaluated at the content level, not at the website or organizational level. Google is looking for content created by subject matter experts.

For YMYL topics, formal qualifications and education of the content creator are crucial. For example, medical advice should come from individuals with relevant medical degrees or certifications. Financial advice should be provided by qualified financial experts.

For non-YMYL topics, Google values what they call "everyday expertise" based on relevant life experience. For instance, a hobbyist photographer might be considered an expert on camera techniques, even without formal photography education.

Interestingly, Google recognizes that even for some YMYL topics, lived experience can be a form of expertise. For example, in answering a query like "what does it feel like to have cancer," content from someone living with the disease might be considered more valuable than that from a doctor who has never experienced it personally.

### Authoritativeness

Authority is about reputation, especially among experts and influencers in the field. When a website or individual is seen as a go-to source of information on a particular topic, that's authority.

Quality raters are instructed to look for independent sources like reviews, references, expert recommendations, and news articles to gauge a website or individual's authority. They're specifically told to look for sources not created by the website or individual themselves.

Wikipedia is mentioned as a good starting point for researching reputation, though it's not the only source. Raters might look at professional societies, awards, and other recognitions as indicators of authority.

It's important to note that authority is topic-specific. A website might be highly authoritative on one subject but have little to no authority on another. For example, Elon Musk and Tesla are authoritative sources on electric vehicles, but they wouldn't be considered authorities on SEO.

### Trustworthiness

Trust relates to the legitimacy, transparency, and accuracy of the website and its content. Several factors contribute to a website's perceived trustworthiness:

1. Clear authorship: Websites should clearly state who is responsible for the content, especially for YMYL topics.

2. Comprehensive contact information: This is particularly important for e-commerce sites and those dealing with YMYL topics. Users should be able to easily find ways to get help if issues arise.

3. Content accuracy: Information should be factually accurate and, where applicable, supported by expert consensus.

4. Citing trustworthy sources: Using and properly citing reputable external sources can enhance the trustworthiness of content.

5. Website security: Secure connections (HTTPS) and proper handling of user data contribute to trustworthiness.

6. Transparency about website purpose: Clear information about who runs the site and its purpose can boost trust.

For YMYL queries, the standards for trustworthiness are particularly high. A medical advice website, for instance, would be expected to have clear information about its authors' qualifications, robust content review processes, and comprehensive contact information.

## Is E-A-T a Ranking Factor?

The answer to this question is nuanced. E-A-T itself isn't directly measurable by computers in the way that, say, page load speed is. You can't assign a numerical E-A-T score to a page. However, Google uses various signals as proxies to assess content quality in line with E-A-T principles.

As Danny Sullivan, Google's Public Liaison for Search, explained in a tweet: "We do use a variety of signals as a proxy to tell if content seems to match E-A-T as humans would assess it. In that regard, yeah, it's a ranking factor."

So how does this work in practice? Google's search engineers continually work on algorithm tweaks aimed at improving search result quality. They then show search results to Quality Raters with and without these proposed changes implemented. The raters provide feedback based on the guidelines, which heavily emphasize E-A-T principles.

If the changes align better with what humans consider to be high E-A-T content, they're more likely to be implemented. In this way, while E-A-T itself isn't a direct ranking factor, it guides the development of Google's ranking algorithms.

## Do Websites Have an E-A-T Score?

No, Google doesn't assign specific E-A-T scores to websites. This is a common misconception in the SEO community. E-A-T is a concept used to guide quality raters and improve search algorithms, not a direct metric used internally by Google.

As Gary Illyes from Google stated, "EAT and YMYL are concepts introduced for Quality Raters to dumb down algorithm concepts. They are not 'scores' used by Google internally."

However, this doesn't mean E-A-T isn't important. While there may not be a specific score, the concepts behind E-A-T deeply inform Google's algorithms and how they evaluate content quality.

## How to Improve and Demonstrate E-A-T

Improving your website's E-A-T involves both enhancing your actual expertise, authority, and trustworthiness, and effectively demonstrating these qualities. Here are some detailed strategies:

1. Build high-quality backlinks from authoritative sites in your niche.
2. Keep your content up-to-date, especially for YMYL topics.
3. Ensure factual accuracy in your content and cite trustworthy sources.
4. Gather positive reviews across relevant platforms for your industry.
5. Hire experts to create content, particularly for YMYL topics.
6. Showcase your credentials and achievements on your website.
7. Provide clear and comprehensive contact information.
8. Aim for a Wikipedia page or mentions, if appropriate for your authority level.
9. Secure mentions and citations from reputable industry websites.

Let's delve deeper into each of these strategies:

### Building Links and Mentions

Links and mentions from authoritative sites play a significant role in establishing E-A-T. Focus on earning high-quality backlinks rather than accumulating low-quality ones. This might involve creating valuable, shareable content, engaging in industry discussions, or collaborating with other reputable entities in your field.

### Content Maintenance

Regularly update your content, especially for YMYL topics. This demonstrates ongoing expertise and commitment to accuracy. Set up a schedule to review and update your most important pages, ensuring that all information remains current and relevant.

### Fact-Checking

Ensure your content is factually accurate and aligns with scientific consensus where applicable. Use trusted sources for verification. For scientific topics, refer to peer-reviewed studies and reputable academic sources. For other topics, cross-reference information with multiple reliable sources.

### Online Reviews

Encourage and manage reviews across relevant platforms for your industry. Positive reviews can boost your reputation and trustworthiness. However, don't engage in fake reviews or review manipulation, as this can severely damage your credibility if discovered.

### Expert Content Creation

For YMYL topics, having content created by qualified experts is crucial. This might mean hiring professionals with relevant degrees or certifications. For other topics, individuals with proven experience in the field can suffice. Always clearly attribute content to its authors and provide information about their qualifications or experience.

### Showcasing Credentials

Display relevant qualifications, speaking engagements, and awards in author bios and about pages. Consider using schema markup to structure this information, making it easier for search engines to understand and potentially display in rich results.

### Contact Information

Provide comprehensive contact details, especially for YMYL sites. The level of expected information may vary based on your website type. For e-commerce sites, for instance, clear policies on returns and customer support are important. For informational sites, an email address and physical location might be sufficient.

### Wikipedia Presence

While challenging to achieve, a Wikipedia page or mentions can significantly boost perceived authority. Aim for this if your business has garnered enough recognition. Remember that Wikipedia has strict notability guidelines, so this strategy is most relevant for well-established entities.

### Industry Mentions

Secure mentions on reputable industry websites. This can be achieved through unique insights, data publication, or services like HARO (Help a Reporter Out). Creating newsworthy content or participating in industry events can also lead to valuable mentions.

## Final Thoughts

Improving E-A-T is a two-step process: first, establish genuine expertise and values, and second, effectively demonstrate these qualities to Google. Remember, having a website doesn't guarantee rankings – Google aims to direct traffic to the most authoritative and trustworthy sources.

It's crucial to understand that E-A-T isn't just about SEO. At its core, it's about providing value to your audience. When you focus on creating truly helpful, accurate content, backed by genuine expertise and transparent practices, you're not just optimizing for search engines – you're building trust with your users.

Keep in mind that E-A-T criteria may evolve as Google updates its guidelines. Stay informed about these changes to maintain and improve your website's E-A-T over time. Regularly review your SEO strategies in light of the latest best practices and Google guidelines.

Enhancing your website's E-A-T is an ongoing process. It requires consistent effort in creating high-quality content, building your brand's reputation, and demonstrating your expertise and trustworthiness. While it may take time to see results, the long-term benefits – both in terms of search visibility and user trust – make it a worthwhile investment for any serious online presence.

In the end, focusing on E-A-T aligns your SEO efforts with Google's ultimate goal: providing users with the most reliable, accurate, and helpful information possible. By prioritizing E-A-T, you're not just improving your chances of ranking well – you're contributing to a better, more trustworthy internet for everyone.
