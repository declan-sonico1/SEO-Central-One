# 7 Content Marketing Conferences to Attend in 2024

I spend most of my days sitting in front of a screen, buried in a Google Doc. (You probably do too.)

And while I enjoy deep work, a few times a year I get the urge to leave my desk and go socialize with other human beings—ideally on my employer’s dime 

Conferences are a great excuse to hang out with other content marketers, talk shop, learn some new tricks, and pretend that we’re all _really excited_ about generative AI.

Without further ado, here are the biggest and best content marketing conferences happening throughout the rest of 2024.

## 1\. CEX 24

**Dates:** May 5–7  
**Prices:** from $795  
**Website:** [https://cex.events/](https://cex.events/)  
**Location:** Cleveland, OH  
**Speakers:** [B.J. Novak](https://twitter.com/BJ__Novak), [Ann Handley](https://twitter.com/MarketingProfs), [Alexis Grant](https://twitter.com/alexisgrant), [Justin Welsh](https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh), [Mike King](https://twitter.com/iPullRank)

CEX is designed with content entrepreneurs in mind (“_contenpreneurs”_? Did I just coin an awesome new word?)—people that care as much about the business of content as they do the craft.

In addition to veteran content marketers like Ann Handley and Joe Pulizi waxing lyrical about modern content strategy, you’ll find people like Justin Welsh and Alexis Grant exploring the practicalities of quitting your job and becoming a full-time content creator.

Here’s a trailer for last year’s event:

Sessions include titles like:

*   _Unlocking the Power of Book Publishing: From Content to Revenue_
*   _Quitting A $200k Corporate Job to Become A Solo Content Entrepreneur_
*   _Why You Should Prioritize Long-Form Content_

(And yes—Ryan from _The Office_ is giving the keynote.)

## 2\. MozCon 2024

Software company Moz is best known in the SEO industry, but its conference is popular with marketers of all stripes. Amidst a lineup of 25 speakers there are plenty of content marketers speaking, like Andy Crestodina, Ross Simmonds, and Chima Mmeje.

I’ve attended my fair share of INBOUNDs over the years (and even had a beer with co-founder Dharmesh Shah), and always enjoy the sheer choice of events on offer.

Keynotes are a highlight, and this year’s headline speaker has a tough act to follow: _Barack Obama_ closed out the conference last year.

**Dates:** Oct 22–23  
**Location:** San Diego, CA  
**Speakers:** TBC  
**Prices:** from $1,199  
**Website:** [https://www.contentmarketingworld.com/](https://www.contentmarketingworld.com/)

Arguably _the_ content marketing conference, Content Marketing World has been pumping out content talks and inspiration for fourteen years solid.

Here’s last year’s recap:

That’s right—Ahrefs is hosting a conference! Join 500 digital marketers for a 2-day gathering in Singapore.

We have 18 top speakers from around the world, expert-led workshops on everything from technical SEO to content strategy, and tons of opportunities to rub shoulders with content pros, big brands, and the entire Ahrefs crew.

I visited Singapore for the first time last year and it is _really_ worth the trip—I recommend visiting the Supertree Grove, eating at the hawker markets in Chinatown, and hitting the beach at Sentosa.

If you need persuading, here’s SEO pro JH Scherck on the [Ahrefs podcast](https://ahrefs.com/podcast) making the case for conference travel:

## 7\. CopyCon 2024

**Dates:** Nov 8  
**Location:** London  
**Speakers:** [Nick Parker](https://www.copywritingconference.com/speakers/nick-parker/), [Tasmin Lofthouse](https://www.copywritingconference.com/speakers/tasmin-lofthouse/), [Dan Nelken](https://www.copywritingconference.com/speakers/dan-nelken/), [Taja Myer](https://www.copywritingconference.com/speakers/tajha-myer/)

CopyCon is a single-day conference in London, hosted by ProCopywriters (a membership community for copywriters—I was a member once, many years ago).

Intended for copywriters, creatives, and content strategists, the agenda focuses heavily on the qualitative aspects of content that often go overlooked—creative processes, tone of voice, and creating emotional connections through copy.

It’s a few years old, but this teaser video shares a sense of the topics on offer:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqLTL-VvwW4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqLTL-VvwW4)

This year’s talks include sessions like:

*   _The Mind-Blowing Magic of Tone of Voice,_
*   _The Power of AI Tools as a Content Designer_, and the beautifully titled
*   _Your Inner Critic is a Ding-Dong_.

(Because _yes,_ your inner critic really is a ding-dong.)

## Final thoughts

These are all content-specific conferences, but there are a ton of content-adjacent events happening throughout the year. Honourable mentions go to [DigiMarCon UK 2024](https://digimarconuk.co.uk/) (Aug 29–30, London, UK), [Web Summit](https://websummit.com/) (Nov 11–14, Lisbon, Portugal), and [B2B Forum](https://mpb2b.marketingprofs.com/) (Nov 12–14, Boston, MA).

I’ve focused this list solely on in-person events, but there are also online-only conferences available, like [ContentTECH Summit](https://content.tech/) (May 15–16).
