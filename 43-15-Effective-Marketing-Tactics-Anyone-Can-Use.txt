# 15 Effective Marketing Tactics Anyone Can Use

Need to promote a brand, but you’re new to marketing? No worries, that’s still doable.

In this article, you will find 15 tried and tested marketing tactics that don’t require experience in marketing.

## 1\. Get traffic from Google with low-difficulty keywords 

[Organic traffic](https://ahrefs.com/blog/organic-search/) from Google is one of the best kinds. It’s consistent, passive, and you don’t need to pay for each click. And this [SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-seo/) tactic is probably the fastest way to tap into that traffic source. 

You will need three things:

*   [Low competition keywords](https://ahrefs.com/academy/ahrefs-youtube/low-competition-keywords) relevant to your business. 
*   [SEO content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-content/) to rank for those keywords. 
*   [Backlinks](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-are-backlinks/) to increase your chances for ranking. But here’s the thing—you likely won’t need many to rank because they are low-difficulty keywords.

Let’s say you’re running a personal finance app. What you’d do is take a bunch of broad terms related to your business, e.g., “budgeting, credit card score, retirement.” You can brainstorm them, source them from your competitor’s website, or even ask ChatGPT. Next: 

1.  Paste them into a tool like [Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer).
2.  In Ahrefs, go to the **Matching terms report.**
3.  Filter for keywords below 20 **KD** (Keyword Difficulty).
4.  Look for ideas. 

![Finding low-competition keywords with Ahrefs.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image21.png)

And if the list is still too big to manage, you can further decrease Keyword Difficulty or set a minimum Traffic Potential to filter out the least popular keywords.

![Refining keyword results using filters.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image14-3.png)

For instance, here are a few interesting keywords. Relevant to a personal finance product, good traffic potential (TP) and low difficulty (KD):

![Example low-competition keywords.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image19.png)

From here, it’s just a case of creating content about the topic and (possibly) building a few links to rank. Read the articles below to learn how:

## 2\. Educate, inspire, and entertain on social media with short-form videos

Social media loves short videos—even if they look amateurish. According to a [study](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/content-benchmarks/) of over 700k profiles across different social media platforms, short-form videos are the most engaging type of content.

The best part? People are okay with these videos not being visual masterpieces. 

Want proof? Duolingo’s meme-like videos went viral on TikTok and Instagram. They’re short, entertaining, and look like they were shot on a phone. 

![Duolingo's example of short, amateurish videos that went viral.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image13-3.jpg)

If what Duolingo does isn’t really your style, there are other ways to use videos. For example, if your company just reached a milestone, why not share that? 

A quick product hack you can share? Go for it. 

This works for tech brands, too:

> You don’t need to upload the list of keywords and wait ⌛ until they will be organised into clusters.

As long as your videos aim to educate, inspire, or entertain your audience, you’re on the right track. So, for example, your videos can be about:

*   Short product demos and feature highlights
*   Your brand’s journey to stardom
*   Behind the scenes 
*   Tips, tricks, and how-to’s 
*   Upcoming product sneak peeks 
*   Hot takes on industry news 
*   Important company news and milestones 
*   Answers to FAQs

How to get started? You can avoid some rookie mistakes with guides like [this one](https://blog.hootsuite.com/short-form-video/). But let’s face it—your first videos won’t be an instant hit. There’s no other way around it than making more videos. 

So stop overthinking and start uploading. Then, if an idea takes off, double down on it.

## 3\. Pitch yourself as a guest on podcasts

People often trust independent creators. Their endorsement can put your brand on the map and raise its profile. 

If you’ve got an interesting story to tell or a topic you’re an expert on, you can do marketing for your brand by just talking about it.

If you do enough of them, you won’t need to pitch; you’ll be regularly invited, just like my colleague [Patrick](https://twitter.com/patrickstox).

But before that happens, here’s what you can do:

*   Target shows that align with your expertise.
*   Start with smaller podcasts to gain experience.
*   Send a clear email outlining your value to the show.
*   If you don’t hear back, send a polite follow-up within two weeks.
*   After appearing, promote the episode on your platforms to benefit both you and the host.

You probably won’t have trouble finding shows to pitch through Google, Apple podcasts, Spotify podcasts, or curated lists you’ll stumble across. But here’s what you also can do:

*   Ask your network for any good shows they’ve seen or watched lately.
*   Use matchmaking services like PodcastGuest or Podmatch.
*   Use SparkToro to see where your audience hangs out. You can find shows directly through YouTube or podcast criteria or see which influencers host their own shows. 

![How to find podcasts with Sparktoro.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7-3.png)

## 4\. Get free press with HARO

[HARO](https://www.helpareporter.com/) stands for Help A Reporter Out. It’s a feed of requests from journalists, bloggers, and other writers who need information for pieces they’re working on.

It’s basically a shortcut to free publicity on a reputable site. Plus, it’s a good way to land a quality [backlink](https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-are-backlinks/) (which can help SEO). 

Your credentials and the value of the information you provide matter the most, not your actual website or content on it. And this makes HARO a great PR technique for projects in their infancy.

To illustrate, here’s the journalist’s query on HARO:

![Example query from HARO.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image17-1.png)

And here’s the answer published on handicappedpets.com with the link to the author’s site. 

![A quote with a backlink published on a reputable site via HARO.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image16-2.png)

All you need to do is sign up for HARO, monitor the requests in your category, and respond with valuable information as fast as possible whenever you see a good opportunity.

Want a few tips from our experience with this tactic?

*   Avoid publications that aren’t authoritative. 
*   Only respond to requests where you can truly provide great information.
*   Don’t deviate from the format the author is requesting.
*   Don’t hesitate to bring colleagues on board if they’re more qualified to answer.

## 5\. Repurpose your content to get more mileage out of it

If you already have content that’s performing well, you can repurpose it for other marketing channels. This allows you to reach new audiences without creating something from scratch.

Here’s an example. Our [SEO checklist video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taU9P98zfjk) has more than 230k views:

![Performance of repurposed video content on YouTube.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image23.jpg)

But we also published it as an article that drives an estimated 9.5k clicks from organic search every month:

![Organic traffic via Ahrefs.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image6-4.png)

Data via Ahrefs.

There is more than one way to do it. Learn more in [our list of 13 ways to repurpose content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/repurposing-content/).

## 6\. Advertise your business with Google Ads

This is probably the quickest way to drive potential customers to any website. 

[Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/) is a shortcut to some of the premium spots on Google Search and Google Maps. You may know them from the first thing you see when you Google something. 

![Example of a Google Ad.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1-5.jpg)

They basically work like this: you choose keywords relevant to your business, set up the ads, and declare how much you’re willing to pay for ads to show up on Google. Then Google runs an auction to decide which advertisers’ ads should be shown. You pay for the ad only if someone clicks on it. 

The cool thing about this channel is that once you grasp it, you can scale it almost instantly by bidding on more keywords and increasing your budget. 

Measuring return on investment is fairly easy here, too. You’re earning money if the ads bring more revenue than they cost. 

Before you set up your first campaign, check our [6 tips for Google Search Ads](https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-engine-marketing/). 

## 7\. Let affiliates do the marketing for you 

Affiliates promote your product or service in return for a commission on the sales they generate.

For example, if you want to spread the word about your life insurance app, an affiliate might recommend it through a review. When a reader clicks through to buy your product, it tracks where the sale came from so you can pay a commission.

![Example of sponsored content published on an affiliate site.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image8-5.png)

You can attract affiliates to your brand in a few ways. Joining an affiliate network is a good starting point. These connect you to publishers who might want to promote your product and take care of the technical side. You only pay a small setup fee and share commissions only if you get paid first. 

Each affiliate network is unique, so make sure to do some research on them before you sign up. 

Pro Tip

You can also find potential affiliates by looking for those who promote your competitors. Here’s how:

1.  Enter the competitor’s site into [Ahrefs’ Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer).
2.  Go to the **Backlinks** report.
3.  Filter for backlinks that contain any of these popular affiliate [URL parameters](https://ahrefs.com/blog/url-parameters/) in the **Target URL**: ?ref, ?clid, ?id.
4.  Filter for **One link per domain**.
5.  Sort the results by **Domain traffic**.
6.  Look for affiliates in the **Referring page column.** 

![Finding affiliates who work for competitors with Ahrefs.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image24.png)

## 8\. Start a newsletter you’d like to get yourself

Many businesses send email newsletters, but their newsletters are boring and provide little value. 

At the same time, newsletters are undergoing a renaissance, which proves that people like to get newsletters—just not bad ones. 

So start a newsletter, but don’t send out boring self-promotional company news week after week. Instead: 

*   Make it personable and fun.
*   Share useful stuff from others, not just your company.
*   If you’re linking to other sites, give a quick overview of the content; don’t just send links. 

And we talk from experience here. We’re a B2B brand, but every [Ahrefs’ Digest](https://ahrefs.com/newsletter) kicks off with a meme:

![Ahrefs' newsletter.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image18-1.jpg)

We then group “news” by topic and write a quick blurb for each to save people time:

![Ahrefs newsletter, contents.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10-4.png)

That’s it. It’s simple, but our readers love it.

You can start for free with tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit, and it’s less technically complicated than you think. But to send out your first email, you need to start building your list. [Here’s how](https://ahrefs.com/blog/grow-email-list/). 

## 9\. Convert visitors into leads with lead magnets 

A lead magnet is a marketing tactic where a brand offers a free resource (ebook, tool, discount, etc.) in exchange for a visitor’s contact information. 

For example, this lead magnet offers a time-saving set of press release templates:

![Example of a lead magnet.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image9-4.png)

Once that company collects the email, they can start a conversation. 

![Email sent after email magnet registration](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image25.png)

Now, some people will get what they want and unsubscribe. But some will stay and read the next emails. Out of that group, some will be interested in checking out what you offer—and some will eventually become your customers. 

When creating lead magnets, make sure not to go it alone. There are tools that will help you create the magnet itself, create a lead capture form, and distribute your freebie.

## 10\. Let happy customers create more happy customers with UGC

User-generated content (UGC) is any form of content, such as reviews, photos, videos, or social media posts, created by consumers rather than by the brand itself. 

This marketing tactic leverages the authentic experiences of existing customers to build trust and credibility. And it works because customers are likely to trust other customers. 

You can encourage UGC by running contests or asking for short testimonials. Then, you can share it on your social media, landing pages, and newsletters and use it for all sorts of campaigns. 

Here, you can see the idea in action. Pakker Trousers uses UGC in all of its channels. Below is their website’s footer and a screenshot from their Instagram feed (real customers, no models).

![Customer testimonials on a website.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image27.jpg)

![User-generated content example: photos of customers wearing the product.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image31.jpg)

The beauty of UGC is that it requires minimal work; you’re essentially letting your satisfied customers do the marketing for you. This enriches your brand’s content strategy and deepens engagement with your community.

## 11\. Speak at industry events to build authority

This strategy positions you as an authority in your industry, builds credibility, and directly connects you with potential clients or partners.

The key is to offer something useful and engaging to encourage people to explore your products or services further. Think insights, case studies, or original research.

This tactic needs less “marketing” than you may think. All you need is a few contextual mentions of your brand, no more, so don’t overdo it. 

![Example of promoting a brand during a talk at a conference.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image22.jpg)

## 12\. Get featured in curated lists in your niche

Many people look for solutions on Google, be it a new tool they can use for work or service to get something done. For instance, “marketing tools” is a phrase that gets 3.2k searches each month. 

![Search volume of a keyword.
](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image26.png)

What people find this way is typically curated lists. 

![Google SERP showing most popular type of results for a keyword.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image5-4.png)

Of course, getting featured in them all would be perfect—but that can be challenging for newcomers. 

But here’s a tip: try to pitch to the more specific lists. Yes, these will be less popular, but that may actually work to your advantage:

*   People looking for something specific are usually closer to making a purchase. 
*   Tools that cater to a very specific audience are harder to find; you’re basically helping out the authors of those lists. 

Get featured in some of those lists, and the next thing you know, you will be featured in more and more lists organically. 

You can use a keyword tool like Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer and study how people may be looking for a product/service like yours. 

1.  Enter the type of your product or service.
2.  Go to the **Matching terms** report. 
3.  Open the **Clusters by Parent Topic** tab (this will help to organize your keyword results).
4.  Find parent topics that fit the functionality of your product. 

![Looking for niche product reviews with Ahrefs.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image11-2.jpg)

Once you find a good topic, click on the **SERP** button to see which sites rank - these will be your prospects to pitch. 

![Using Ahrefs' SERP view to find pages to be featured on.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-5.png)

To illustrate, here are some tool niches I found this way. Naturally, you won’t need to tick all of the boxes, just find a few that make sense for your business. 

![Example product niches found via keyword research.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image15-3.png)

Something that can help get featured is helping the content creator do their homework:

*   Make it clear why their audience needs to hear about your product/service.
*   Show them you’re the real deal. Show user testimonials, links to sites where you’ve already been featured, mention VCs that backed you… you get the idea. 
*   Give them a kit full of pictures, videos, and details about your product. If you can, offer to hop on a call and do a live demo. 

## 13\. Write for other websites in your industry

[Guest posting](https://ahrefs.com/blog/guest-blogging/) is when you publish content on another website.

You’re giving away [good content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-write-great-content/), but in return, you get: 

*   Brand exposure to someone else’s audience. 
*   A backlink. 
*   New connections in the industry.
*   A bit of referral traffic. 

If there’s a website you love that you want to pitch, go for it. Even if they don’t say they take guest posts, they might be interested in what you’ve got. 

But to make the best out of this tactic, prioritize sites that get traffic from Google (an indication they’re potentially quality sites) and are open to featuring new writers in the field. You can find these sites with [Ahrefs’ Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer). 

1.  Enter a broad keyword or phrase related to your niche. If you’d like to use more than one, separate them with the OR operator. 
2.  Select **In title** from the drop-down menu.
3.  Set the **Domain Rating** filter to “30 to 80”, website traffic from 20,000, and **Only live** mode. You can also set the preferred language. 
4.  Run the search.

![Setting up Ahrefs' Content Explorer to find guest blogging opportunities.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3-6.png)

On the results page, exclude homepages and subdomains. 

![Filters in Content Explorer.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image29.png)

Then open the **Websites** tab.

![Websites tab in Content Explorer.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image20.png)

Finally, pitch your idea. That will be the hardest part of the entire process, but lucky for you, we’ve done a fair bit of guest blogging, and we’re sharing our lessons in this guide to [guest blogging for SEO](https://ahrefs.com/blog/guest-blogging/). 

## 14\. Ask happy customers to leave a review on Google 

Reviews in your [Google Business Profile](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-my-business/) (GBP) can help you rank higher in Google Maps and “map pack” results in Google search. [Google relies on them](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en) to determine local ranking, and they’re one of the strongest local ranking factors, to [our knowledge](https://ahrefs.com/blog/local-seo/#local-seo-ranking-factors). 

So, for example, people looking for a local vet will first discover recommended GBPs.

![Map pack in Google Search.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4-4.jpg)

But here’s the thing about reviews. You can encourage them, but you should never pay for them. And it’s probably not a good idea to incentivize reviews with prizes, discounts, etc. 

So step 1: provide great service. You’re not going to get positive reviews unless you do this.

Step 2: remind customers to leave a review. Kindly. You can put a QR code with a [special link](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3474122?hl=en#create_and_share_a_link) in visible places like your receipts, packaging, email, chats, or even put up a hand-made sign like this one: 

![Example of a small business asking for reviews on Google via a simple hand-made sign.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image12-3.png)

Very simple means to get reviews, but it works. I actually left a review after seeing this.

## 15\. Update old content to rank higher and get more traffic 

Old content may lose rankings in Google for reasons that are often easy to fix.

For example, when we refreshed our article on SEO statistics, we jumped in rankings and got more organic traffic, as shown in the screenshot below. Why? Simple. People wanted up-to-date statistics. 

![Effects of content refreshing (organic traffic increase).](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image30.png)

Data via Ahrefs.

But the question is, how do you find content that’s ripe for a refresh in the first place?

1.  Enter your site into [Ahrefs’ Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer).
2.  Go to **Opportunities** and open the **Content with declining traffic** report.

![Opportunities report in Ahrefs.](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image28.jpg)

Data via Ahrefs.

You will see pages that have lost the most traffic in the last six months and could likely use a refresh. Read our [guide to republishing content](https://ahrefs.com/blog/republishing-content/) to learn how to do that.

## Final thoughts 

These tactics are one of the easiest, but they’re still a lot of work. So here’s how you can go through that list and stay sane:

*   Treat them as ideas. You don’t need to do all of them, and you don’t need to use them all at once.
*   Start with the ones that make the most sense for your business. 
*   If you’ve already tried any of those tactics and it didn’t work before, see the guides we recommended - maybe they’ll help you look at the problem with fresh eyes.
*   Once you start seeing results, start scaling and/or outsourcing. 
*   Finally, after some time, gather your best tactics. They will lay the foundation for your [marketing strategy](https://ahrefs.com/blog/content-marketing-strategy/).
